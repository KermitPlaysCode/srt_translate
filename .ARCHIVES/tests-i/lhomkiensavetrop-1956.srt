1
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:24,204
Daddy, you're sure I've
never been to Africa before?

2
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:26,039
It looks familiar.

3
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:30,627
You saw the same scenery
last summer driving to Las Vegas.

4
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:33,797
Sure. Where Daddy lost
all that money at the crap...

5
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,965
Hey!

6
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,800
...table.

7
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,137
Hey, look! A camel.

8
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:47,310
Of course this isn't really Africa,
honey. It's the French Morocco.

9
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:48,854
Well, it's northern
Africa.

10
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,564
Still seems
like Las Vegas.

11
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,607
We're just 100 miles
north of the Sahara desert.

12
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:54,526
Do you realize
that, son?

13
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:58,238
I don't know. In school, they
call this the dark continent.

14
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,741
This is twice as
bright as Indianapolis.

15
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:03,034
You just wait till
we get to Marrakech.

16
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:05,579
Marrakesh?
Sounds like a drink.

17
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,373
It sure does.

18
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:41,865
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

19
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,283
Hold on here.
What's the matter?

20
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:07,307
Well, I sure want
to thank you.

21
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,643
Without your help, anything
might have happened here.

22
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,436
<i>My Measure,
monsieur.</i>

23
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,523
There are moments in life
when we all need a little help.

24
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:17,651
Yeah. Just what
was the trouble?

25
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,821
Your little boy accidentally
pulled off his wife's veil.

26
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:21,947
You know?
Yeah.

27
00:05:22,906 --> 00:05:23,990
Hank!

28
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:25,325
I want to introduce
my wife, Mrs. McKenna.

29
00:05:25,408 --> 00:05:27,035
How do you do?
How do you do, madame?

30
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,453
My name is
Louis Bernard.

31
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:31,039
Well, we thank you
very much, Mr. Bernard.

32
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,290
That's our son, Hank.

33
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:33,458
Hello, Hank.

34
00:05:33,542 --> 00:05:35,502
Hello.
You talk Arab talk.

35
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:37,587
A few words.

36
00:05:37,671 --> 00:05:39,923
Why was he so angry?
It was just an accident.

37
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:44,219
But the Muslim religion
allows for few accidents.

38
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,179
Yeah, I suppose so.

39
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:47,264
May I...

40
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,266
Yeah, sit down right
in front of Jo there.

41
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,894
I thought
his name was Hank.

42
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:56,481
No, it's my wife's name.
You see, J—O. No "."E

43
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:57,691
How different.

44
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:58,900
It's short
for Josephine.

45
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:01,528
I've called her that so long nobody
knows her by any other name.

46
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:02,612
No. Do they?

47
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:03,738
I do. Mommy.

48
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:05,031
Yeah.
Forgot about that.

49
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:06,825
Now, about
the accident.

50
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:09,953
You see, a Muslim woman
never takes off her veil in public

51
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,663
under any circumstances. I see.

52
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,206
You mean they feed
intravenously?

53
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,374
No, Hank.

54
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:17,252
What a big word
for such a small boy.

55
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:19,296
You see,
I'm a doctor.

56
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,839
Well,
he sounds like one.

57
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:24,050
Yeah.
He can spell hemoglobin.

58
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:27,262
Of course, he has a little trouble
with words like dog and cat.

59
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:31,141
Where do you
practice, Doctor?

60
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:34,519
Indianapolis, Indiana. Good
Samaritan Hospital out there.

61
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:36,521
What brings you
to Marrakech?

62
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:39,274
You see, we were attending
a medical convention in Paris.

63
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,817
And I thought as much as
as we were in Europe,

64
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:43,320
I'd come down and
see Morocco again.

65
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:46,031
Daddy liberated
Africa.

66
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,742
Well, I was stationed
up in Casablanca

67
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:51,536
at an army field hospital
during the war.

68
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:53,872
Do you live in Morocco,
Mr. Bernard?

69
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:54,956
No.

70
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,834
I suppose you came
directly from Paris.

71
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,295
We looked in on
Lisbon and Rome.

72
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:01,630
And Casablanca.

73
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:02,923
And Casablanca.

74
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:06,885
I hope you will have time
to truly enjoy Marrakech.

75
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:10,555
Well, let's see. We'll have
at the most about three days.

76
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,685
You will naturally be stopping at
the hotels La Mamounia or La Menara.

77
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,479
Why do you ask?

78
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:20,649
Because they are hotels
for tourists of good taste.

79
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:23,777
Do you live in
France, Mr. Bernard?

80
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:24,861
Sometimes.

81
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:26,112
Do you eat snails?

82
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:28,573
When I'm lucky
enough to get them.

83
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:31,451
Well, if you ever get hungry, our
garden back home is full of snails.

84
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:32,786
Thank you for
the invitation.

85
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:36,623
That's all right. We tried
everything to get rid of them.

86
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,416
We never thought
of a Frenchman.

87
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,518
Here we go.

88
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,980
Say, do you want to share a
taxi with us down to the hotel?

89
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,732
That's kind of you,
Doctor,

90
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:45,775
but unfortunately, I
have some business first.

91
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:46,860
I see.

92
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,570
What business are
you in, Mr. Bernard?

93
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:51,656
However, I'll be there later. Perhaps
we might have a drink together.

94
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,867
Well, no, come up to our
suite. We'll have a drink up there.

95
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,702
In that case, I will
take you to dinner.

96
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:57,454
No, that's not fair.

97
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,663
But I know Marrakesh.

98
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:00,498
I can show you an
intriguing Arab restaurant

99
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:03,126
where the food is different
and the manner of eating exotic.

100
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,879
Well, that's what we came
here for. How about it, Jo?

101
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,630
How about one of
those Arabian nights?

102
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,132
I'd love it.

103
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:12,677
How would you prefer to travel
to the hotel? By taxi, fiacre?

104
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:13,720
Gee, I don't know.

105
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,930
A wagon! I wanna
ride in a wagon!

106
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,058
Well, I guess
it's a wagon.

107
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:19,684
See you later.

108
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:22,020
Au revoir. I look
forward to the cocktails.

109
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:23,146
Good-bye. Come on.

110
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,522
Bye.

111
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,985
Hank, you sit up
with the driver.

112
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:32,113
How do you like this?
A horse-drawn convertible.

113
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:48,421
Well, I just saw Louis
Bernard talking to that Arab.

114
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:49,547
What Arab?

115
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:51,591
The one that was shouting
at Hank for pulling the veil off.

116
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,468
They were talking like
they were very dear friends.

117
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:56,846
Well, he probably knew him
before. What does that mean?

118
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:00,433
It means that Mr. Bernard
is a very mysterious man.

119
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:03,353
What? He seemed
perfectly normal to me.

120
00:10:04,479 --> 00:10:06,314
Now, what do you
really know about him?

121
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:08,024
What do I know about
him? I know his name.

122
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,692
We were sitting there.
We were talking.

123
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:11,736
You don't know anything
about this man,

124
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,447
and he knows everything
there is to know about you.

125
00:10:14,531 --> 00:10:15,824
Wait.

126
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:18,284
He knows that you live
in Indianapolis, Indiana.

127
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:21,371
He knows that you're a doctor
at the Good Samaritan Hospital.

128
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:24,624
And he knows that you attended
a medical convention in Paris,

129
00:10:24,707 --> 00:10:27,168
and that you stopped off in
Rome, and Lisbon and Casablanca

130
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:28,461
for just a few days.

131
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:29,629
All right.

132
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:34,217
And he knows that you served in
north Africa in an army field hospital.

133
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,679
Honey, it was just a casual
conversation. That's all.

134
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:39,806
Darling, you weren't
just talking casually.

135
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:43,184
He was asking all kinds of questions,
and you were answering them.

136
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:45,019
You might as well have
handed him your passport.

137
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:46,271
Well, what's
the difference?

138
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:49,649
We just have a conversation.
I've got nothing to hide.

139
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:52,193
I have a feeling
that Mr. Bernard has.

140
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:53,528
Honey.

141
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,822
I know this is
mysterious Morocco,

142
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:58,616
but we're not going to
lose our head, are we?

143
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,535
I know.
I know what it is.

144
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:01,619
What?

145
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:05,415
Why, you're sore because this
fella didn't ask you any questions.

146
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,833
Hardy-har-har.

147
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,585
<i>Hardy-hat.</i>

148
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:51,961
Well, this eases
the pain.

149
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:53,713
What pain, Mommy?

150
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:54,797
It's just an expression, honey.

151
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,299
Hey, can you take care
of the driver? Yes, sir.

152
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,051
My name is McKenna,
Dr. McKenna.

153
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,302
I'll take care of
everything, sir.

154
00:12:05,266 --> 00:12:06,351
Come on.

155
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:07,435
We're being watched.

156
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,479
What? Come on!

157
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:28,414
Que <i>sera, sera</i>

158
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:31,584
<i>What will be, will be</i>

159
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:36,297
<i>When I was just a little boy</i>

160
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:41,052
<i>I asked my mother
what will I be</i>

161
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,470
He'll make
a fine doctor.

162
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:47,475
<i>Will I be handsome?
Will I be rich?</i>

163
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:49,269
<i>Here's what she said to me</i>

164
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:51,646
Come on, darling.

165
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:55,775
<i>Que sera, sera</i>

166
00:12:55,858 --> 00:13:00,196
<i>Whatever will be,
will be</i>

167
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:04,284
<i>The future's
not ours to see</i>

168
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:07,453
<i>Que sera, sera</i>

169
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:12,208
<i>What will be, will be</i>

170
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,960
Second verse.

171
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:18,381
<i>When I was
just a child in school</i>

172
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:23,052
<i>I asked my teacher
what should I try</i>

173
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,387
Catch.

174
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:29,183
<i>Should I paint pictures?
Should I sing songs?</i>

175
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:32,812
<i>This was her wise reply</i>

176
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:36,941
<i>Que sera, sera</i>

177
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:41,321
<i>Whatever will be, will
be</i>

178
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:45,491
<i>The future's not
ours to see</i>

179
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:48,202
<i>Que sera, sera</i>

180
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:49,871
Oops!

181
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:53,333
<i>What will be, will be</i>

182
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,209
May I have this next dance? Yes.

183
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:56,294
All right.

184
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,927
You're divine.

185
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:11,893
Dinner for the boy.

186
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,729
Yeah, come in. Right
around the corner.

187
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,735
I can't tell you how
beautifully your wife sings.

188
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:21,819
Pretty good,
isn't she?

189
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:24,030
She's marvelous.

190
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,990
Too bad it was
interrupted.

191
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:28,284
I had that same feeling
myself many times.

192
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:29,869
Well, everything's fine.

193
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:31,079
The manager has
a babysitter for us.

194
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:32,205
Good.

195
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,791
Mrs. McKenna, permit me the
pleasure of serving you a drink.

196
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,793
I would love it.
Thank you.

197
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,962
Were you on the American
stage, Mrs. McKenna?

198
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:46,135
Yes, Mr. Bernard, I was
on the American stage,

199
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:47,804
and the London stage,
and the Paris stage.

200
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,891
I thought perhaps you had
seen me in Paris, being French.

201
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,811
You know, the
theater requires time,

202
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,522
and for me, time
is often a luxury.

203
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:02,652
Have you ever been
to Paris, Mr. Bernard?

204
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,153
I was born there.

205
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,205
What business are you in?

206
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:17,041
I buy and sell.

207
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:18,501
What?

208
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,878
Whatever gives
the best profit.

209
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,259
Well, now that
you're in Marrakech,

210
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,261
what are you
buying and selling?

211
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:32,640
You know, I would much
rather talk about the stage.

212
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,434
If you tell me what
shows you are in...

213
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,855
Would you excuse me?
I'll get it.

214
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:39,939
No, I got it.

215
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,190
No, IWill.

216
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,586
I'm inquiring for the room
of Monsieur Montgomery.

217
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,880
He asked me for
a drink, and I...

218
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,882
I'm sorry. There's
no Montgomery here.

219
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,301
Pardon me, monsieur.
I regret disturbing you.

220
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:09,510
Okay.

221
00:16:20,563 --> 00:16:21,606
May I use your
telephone, please?

222
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:22,690
Yeah, sure.
It's right there.

223
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:23,983
Mommy!
Yes?

224
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,526
I can't
cut this meat.

225
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,612
IWIdoitforyou,
dean

226
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:38,122
Hello?

227
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:55,515
I'm terribly sorry, but I cannot
go to dinner with you tonight.

228
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,309
I have neglected
an important matter

229
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:00,102
which now requires
my attention.

230
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:01,270
I see.

231
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,022
Perhaps
another night?

232
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:05,691
Sure. Sure. We'll
get together again.

233
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:07,527
Good-bye.
Good-bye.

234
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,988
Good night.
Bye.

235
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:14,116
Good night.

236
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:32,635
My name's McKenna.

237
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:36,305
Of course. The hotel
phoned. Follow me, please.

238
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:40,226
I think you will
find this comfortable.

239
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,687
Thank you very much.

240
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:17,221
Honey, move over here.
Let me sit out there.

241
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:27,940
You're on my dress.

242
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:42,747
VVhoop!

243
00:18:57,303 --> 00:18:58,804
Yeah.

244
00:18:58,888 --> 00:19:00,556
We always wash the
hands before eating.

245
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,608
Thank you.

246
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,658
VVhoop!

247
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,495
Those people
are staring at us.

248
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:23,663
What people?

249
00:19:23,746 --> 00:19:25,331
Right in back of us.
What?

250
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:26,916
Yes.
Here.

251
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,794
They were staring at us
in front of the hotel too.

252
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:32,380
Jo, will you please
stop imagining things?

253
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:34,340
I'm not.

254
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:37,176
Good evening. You must
think me awfully rude.

255
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:40,388
I've been staring at you ever
since I saw you at the hotel.

256
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:43,516
You are Jo Conway,
the Jo Conway?

257
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:44,684
Yes, I am.

258
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,644
Didn't I tell you?
I knew I was right.

259
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,854
I'm Lucy Drayton,
and this is my husband.

260
00:19:48,938 --> 00:19:50,064
How do you do?
How do you do?

261
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:51,691
We're Dr. and
Mrs. McKenna.

262
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:53,901
My wife tells me
Mrs. McKenna appeared

263
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:55,861
at the London Palladium
a few years ago.

264
00:19:55,945 --> 00:19:57,446
Of course, we hardly
ever see a show now.

265
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,073
Edward is such an
old stick in the mud.

266
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:01,826
So I have to console
myself with your records.

267
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:03,244
I must admit I love them.

268
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,579
I'm not one for
this terrible bebop

269
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:07,123
or whatever you
call it.

270
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,917
Thank you very much. When
are you coming back to London?

271
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,211
Possibly never again,
professionally.

272
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:13,379
Don't say you're
giving up the stage.

273
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:14,880
Well, temporarily,
I am.

274
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:16,841
Well, it's just
that I'm a doctor,

275
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:19,009
and you know, a doctor's
wife never has as much time...

276
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:20,302
What my husband
is trying to say

277
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:23,472
is Broadway musical shows are
not produced in Indianapolis, Indiana.

278
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:25,599
Well, you know... Of course,
we could live in New York.

279
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:28,060
I hear that doctors aren't
starving there either.

280
00:20:28,144 --> 00:20:31,063
Well, it's not that I have any
objection to working in New York.

281
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:33,065
It's just that it'd be
hard for my patients

282
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:35,109
to come from
Indianapolis for treatment.

283
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:37,820
You know, dear, I'm always
saying the wrong thing. I'm sorry.

284
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,071
Not in the least.

285
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:40,781
Tell me,
Dr. McKenna, do you also go...

286
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:45,995
Hey, why don't all of you sort of
turn around here or something.

287
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,955
It's kind of kind
of hard on the neck.

288
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:51,333
It's in one of
our English counties.

289
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:52,835
It's not what
you'd call a farm.

290
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,587
It's really more
of a small holding.

291
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,172
Here we are.

292
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:58,549
Isn't that
fascinating?

293
00:20:58,632 --> 00:20:59,675
Yes.

294
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:02,052
There we are.

295
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:07,558
Hey, they look good.
Surprise.

296
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,602
They look wonderful.

297
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:12,730
Looks like bread.

298
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,399
We're not going to
eat all that, are we?

299
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:16,484
No.

300
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,403
Is that the way you
do it? Just break it?

301
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:22,448
Yes, just break it. Just
break it. Just like this.

302
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:25,117
It won't break.
No.

303
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:27,953
Well, I'm gonna...
There.

304
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:29,163
Is that the way
you do it?

305
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:31,207
That's quite all right.

306
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,250
That was
a tough one.

307
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:35,961
Does it chew any
better than it tears?

308
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,174
Is it fattening?

309
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,842
I imagine
it might be.

310
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:44,929
No, it's pretty
good,hon.

311
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,139
Well, I...
No plate.

312
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:48,224
No?
No.

313
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,350
No knife or forks.

314
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,977
That's right. I understand
you're just supposed to dig in.

315
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:53,979
Allow me to show you,
will you?

316
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:56,982
You use only the first two
fingers and thumb of the right hand.

317
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:58,567
You don't use the
other two fingers,

318
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:00,361
and always the left
hand in the lap.

319
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:01,570
I see.

320
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:02,988
May I show you?

321
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:04,490
Just these two
fingers?

322
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:07,243
Can I help you?
I'll hold it for you.

323
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:16,544
That's it.
There we are.

324
00:22:18,963 --> 00:22:20,256
Well...

325
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:25,010
Boy, could I use this
hand now. I can't...

326
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,264
It's all right. Nobody
minds. No one minds.

327
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,390
That's good style.

328
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:30,474
No one minds.

329
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:31,559
It's messy,
but worth it.

330
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:32,852
I think I'll practice
on an olive.

331
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,856
Honey, it's wonderful.
Here. Take a bite.

332
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:39,024
Good?
Yeah.

333
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:40,693
Tell me, does this
way of eating

334
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,278
have to do with
religion or something?

335
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,280
I think it's more
social than religious.

336
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:45,447
I don't know.

337
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:48,450
It seems like to me if you have
four good fingers and a thumb,

338
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:51,370
you ought to be able
to use all of them.

339
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:52,705
It's very good,
isn't it?

340
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:53,956
Very good.

341
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,125
Well, as I was saying,

342
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:59,753
I was quite happy farming my bit
of land down in Buckinghamshire

343
00:22:59,837 --> 00:23:02,464
when these United Nations
fellows started worrying me.

344
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:04,341
Edward was a big noise
in the Ministry of Food

345
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:05,718
during the war,
you know.

346
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,344
So we pulled ourselves
up by the roots,

347
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:10,222
and here we are,
United Nations Relief.

348
00:23:10,306 --> 00:23:11,640
Sounds like
interesting work.

349
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:15,060
I'm preparing a report on
soil erosion at the moment.

350
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:16,729
You know,
parts of this country

351
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:19,064
are not unlike your
Dust Bowl formation.

352
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:22,568
A thin layer of topsoil
and underneath...

353
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:33,787
How do you like that? First he
promises to take us to dinner...

354
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:37,458
Yeah. Well, we just
met him today, honey.

355
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,919
You can't expect him
to change his whole life.

356
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:41,253
Ben, what's the
matter with you?

357
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:42,338
What's the matter
with me?

358
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,423
There's nothing the matter with
me. What's the matter with you?

359
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:46,759
I just don't want to
be insulted. That's all.

360
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:49,011
You're not
being insulted.

361
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,429
After all, you can't
blame him, can we,

362
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:53,307
for turning down an old married
couple like us for a girl like that.

363
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,850
We're not an old
married couple!

364
00:23:54,934 --> 00:23:56,936
All right.
All right.

365
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:59,480
All right, he's a heel.
I don't understand him,

366
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:02,441
but I'm beginning not to like
what he's doing to our whole night.

367
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:04,944
I must do
some shopping in the market tomorrow.

368
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:09,031
I do hope it'll be fine.
Well, not too fine.

369
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,325
Of course, I know that our
English weather is pretty awful,

370
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:14,411
but sometimes, you know, I think
we don't realize when we're lucky.

371
00:24:14,495 --> 00:24:17,039
All this sunshine
day after day,

372
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,458
well, it doesn't
seem natural somehow.

373
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:20,501
I want to get up.

374
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:21,627
Ben, don't.

375
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,629
I know you. Once you get
worked up, you start a fight.

376
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,756
Now, forget about him.

377
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,134
Will you come to the
market with us tomorrow?

378
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:31,804
As a matter of fact, Louis
Bernard, the big buyer from Paris,

379
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:33,806
was going to take us to
the marketplace tomorrow.

380
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:35,683
Yeah. Yeah, I think I'll
go over and cancel out.

381
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:38,978
Now, Ben, sit down and eat
your dinner. It's getting cold.

382
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:40,145
We'd love to go.

383
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:41,939
Good, good.
We'd be delighted.

384
00:24:42,523 --> 00:24:46,235
I don't know why he gets so
worked up over unimportant things.

385
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,243
<i>Monsieur!</i>

386
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:59,058
What's he saying,
Mrs. Drayton?

387
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:00,809
He's the teller
of tales, Hank.

388
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,273
Isn't this exciting?

389
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:08,400
Just like the county
fair when I was a kid.

390
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:11,445
They got everything but
the balloon ascension.

391
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:16,617
What's so funny about that? Did
you ever see a balloon ascension?

392
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,785
No, you know what
I was just thinking?

393
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:19,828
You know what's paying for
these three days in Marrakech?

394
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:20,913
Me.

395
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,664
Mrs. Campbell's
gallstones.

396
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:26,168
You know the purse I
bought in Paris? Yeah.

397
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,670
Bill Edward's tonsils.

398
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:30,422
Mommy! Daddy!

399
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:34,468
Daddy, come with us! We're
gonna see the medicine man.

400
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:36,095
Maybe you can learn
something, Daddy.

401
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:37,805
I wouldn't be
a bit surprised.

402
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:39,098
Anytime he starts
wearing you out...

403
00:26:39,181 --> 00:26:42,476
I haven't enjoyed
the market so much.

404
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:45,771
You know, I never
thought of it that way before.

405
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:46,939
What?

406
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:49,233
I'm wearing Johnny
Matthews' appendix.

407
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:52,111
Dear.
What about the boat trip?

408
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:53,695
Let's see, it took
two boys, one girl

409
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,322
and two sets of twins,
didn't it?

410
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:56,615
And Mrs. Morgan's
hives.

411
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:05,874
Well, how are the
acrobats today?

412
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:06,959
Wonderful.

413
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:09,628
Watch that kid that goes clear
to the top there. He's great.

414
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:11,713
I'll see you later.
Yes.

415
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:18,554
All the way home, we'll be
riding on Herbie Taylor's ulcers.

416
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:20,889
And AIIida Markle's
asthma.

417
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:22,558
Now, if we could
just get four cases

418
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,476
of the seven-year itch,
we could retire.

419
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,478
Or if Mrs. Yarro's really
gonna have triplets,

420
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:28,438
we could completely redecorate
the house, couldn't we?

421
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:32,317
What would they say
if they heard us?

422
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:34,862
You know, one of the reasons I
came to a place like Marrakech

423
00:27:34,945 --> 00:27:37,990
is so we could say things like
that Without everybody hearing us.

424
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:43,328
Well, I'd like to say something
where nobody could hear us.

425
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:44,872
This is
the safest place.

426
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:47,583
When are we going
to have another baby?

427
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,878
You're the doctor.
You have all the answers.

428
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:53,964
Yeah, but this is the first time
I've ever heard the question.

429
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:56,258
Mommy, look!
Come here!

430
00:28:00,137 --> 00:28:03,974
Look. Sewing machines. Looks
like a television commercial.

431
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:06,810
Having a good time,
Hank?

432
00:28:06,894 --> 00:28:07,895
I guess so.

433
00:28:07,978 --> 00:28:10,022
He's delighted
with everything.

434
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:11,607
Coming through! Coming through!

435
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:19,740
Hank! Hank,
come back here!

436
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:20,824
Hank!

437
00:28:20,908 --> 00:28:23,035
Hank!
Hank!

438
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,745
It's best to keep
out of trouble, Hank.

439
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:26,413
What's going on?

440
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,749
Looks like the police
are chasing somebody.

441
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:31,561
Hey.
Hey, look there.

442
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:37,359
You better stand back.
Go on. Stand back.

443
00:29:54,084 --> 00:29:55,335
<i>Monsieur</i> McKenna.

444
00:29:57,296 --> 00:30:00,090
I'm Louis Bernard.

445
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:09,057
A man, a statesman,

446
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:16,148
he is to be killed,
assassinated, in London.

447
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:20,068
Soon, very soon.

448
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:25,282
Tell them in London.

449
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:30,537
Ambrose Chappell.

450
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:02,736
Ben, who is he?
Louis Bernard.

451
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,696
You got something to
write on? Louis Bernard?

452
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,448
He's dead.

453
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,310
He says,
"Do you know this man?"

454
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:38,897
Yes, we do know him.
He's Louis Bernard, the...

455
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,440
Louis Bernard?

456
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:44,486
<i>Monsieur and
Madame</i> McKenna.

457
00:31:48,365 --> 00:31:50,784
He wants you to go to police
headquarters to make a statement.

458
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:52,035
Okay.

459
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:54,162
Our friends have to go
to the police station.

460
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:56,248
I think I better go with
them. Yes, of course.

461
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:06,508
You don't want your little boy to
go, do you?

462
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,886
But I
want to go to the police station.

463
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:12,347
I think it better if I take him
back to the hotel, don't you?

464
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:13,765
Would you please?
Certainly.

465
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:16,560
Thank you.
You be a good boy, Hank.

466
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,021
We're to be going now.

467
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:22,732
Heaven knows when
we shall be back.

468
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:30,323
Ben, why do you suppose
he turned up in an Arab outfit

469
00:32:30,407 --> 00:32:31,992
and wearing make-up?

470
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:34,453
What's more important,
why was he killed?

471
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:36,580
I'll bet he was a spy
or something like that.

472
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:38,498
What were you writing down?
What was he telling you?

473
00:32:38,582 --> 00:32:40,625
I'll tell you later.

474
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:43,628
What is it?

475
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:45,755
I just feel
kind of funny.

476
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:50,051
Why should he pick
me out to tell?

477
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:53,513
After what we said about
him last night, the poor fella.

478
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:07,652
When we get in
with the inspector,

479
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:09,654
I'll do my best to cut
some of the red tape.

480
00:33:09,738 --> 00:33:11,323
Fine. Fine.

481
00:33:11,448 --> 00:33:13,074
Well, I'm going
to stretch a bit.

482
00:33:14,451 --> 00:33:16,786
I'm afraid the questions
will go on till doomsday

483
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:19,039
if you admit you knew
this chap Bernard before.

484
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:21,666
I don't know him at all.
We met yesterday on a bus.

485
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,919
They're a cynical lot,
you know, these French.

486
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,962
They might refuse
to believe that.

487
00:33:26,046 --> 00:33:29,090
Well, they've got to
believe it. It's the truth.

488
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:31,176
Look at it from
their point of view.

489
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:33,136
They saw this poor
fellow whispering to you,

490
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,597
and then they saw you
write something down.

491
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,098
Are you gonna show
them what you wrote?

492
00:33:58,078 --> 00:34:01,706
Thank you, Mr. Drayton, but a
translator will not be necessary.

493
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:04,626
Won't <i>you</i> come inside,
<i>madame, monsieur?</i>

494
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:07,254
Please do me
the kindness to wait.

495
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:09,589
I might have questions
for you later.

496
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:10,715
Very good.

497
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:24,104
Passports, please.

498
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:40,912
You came to French
Morocco four days ago.

499
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:42,998
That's right.

500
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:45,375
You are a doctor, sir?

501
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:49,379
Yes, I'm a surgeon, a
tourist and American citizen.

502
00:34:50,297 --> 00:34:51,590
Three good reasons
why you should have

503
00:34:51,673 --> 00:34:53,091
nothing in common
with Louis Bernard.

504
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:54,718
I didn't have.

505
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,305
You were in Paris
recently?

506
00:34:58,388 --> 00:35:01,224
Yes, I was attending
a medical convention.

507
00:35:01,308 --> 00:35:02,684
You came to Marrakech
with him in the same bus,

508
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,519
had an aperitif with
him in your hotel room,

509
00:35:04,603 --> 00:35:06,730
and you ate at the same
restaurant last night.

510
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:08,857
Yes, but at
different tables.

511
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:15,947
So Louis Bernard is
a stranger to you?

512
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:19,451
I met him for the first time
in my life yesterday on a bus.

513
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:25,457
And yet out of 5,000 people
in a great marketplace,

514
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,584
he comes to you when
he is about to die.

515
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:32,297
Is that the action of a casual
acquaintance, <i>monsieur?</i>

516
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:35,008
I know absolutely nothing
about Louis Bernard.

517
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:38,928
No. Not even, I suppose, that he
was an agent of the Deuxieme Bureau?

518
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,557
What's that?

519
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:45,644
Perhaps you have also never
heard of the American FBI?

520
00:35:45,727 --> 00:35:46,853
Now, wait...

521
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:49,272
It would be so much easier
for both of us, <i>monsieur,</i>

522
00:35:49,356 --> 00:35:50,523
if you would
cease to pretend.

523
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:51,733
Look here...

524
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:55,779
The dead man found out what
he had been sent here to discover.

525
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:57,906
That's why he was killed.

526
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:01,576
He told you what he
had discovered. Why?

527
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:06,206
Because he placed complete
confidence in you. Not true?

528
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:07,874
Boy, you not only
ask the questions,

529
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:09,501
you answer them too,
don't you?

530
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:12,003
Let me ask you a question.

531
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:16,341
Assuming that Bernard trusted
me as implicitly as you say,

532
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:20,011
then I'd never reveal anything
he said to me, would I?

533
00:36:20,095 --> 00:36:25,350
Even Americans, I suppose,
find it sometimes desirable

534
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:26,685
to betray a confidence.

535
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:28,853
Wait a minute. Let's get
some things straight here.

536
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:31,272
I'm a tourist. I'm
traveling for pleasure.

537
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:33,983
I somehow got involved in
this very unfortunate incident.

538
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:36,069
I came here to make a
simple statement of fact

539
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:38,071
and not be subjected
to a police grilling.

540
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:39,155
<i>Monsieur,</i>
I would like you...

541
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:40,865
No, you let me finish. Now, let
me finish.

542
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:42,200
<i>Entrez!</i>

543
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:46,371
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

544
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:48,164
Did he say I was
wanted on the telephone?

545
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:51,626
I'll take that call now.
And you just take it easy.

546
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:04,848
Hello.

547
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:05,932
Dr. McKenna?

548
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:07,600
This is Dr. McKenna.
Who's this?

549
00:37:07,684 --> 00:37:09,936
If you tell even one word

550
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:13,898
of what Louis Bernard whispered
to you in the marketplace,

551
00:37:13,982 --> 00:37:16,609
your little boy will
be in serious danger.

552
00:37:17,444 --> 00:37:20,238
<i>Remember, say nothing.</i>

553
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:26,369
Hello?

554
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:36,004
Drayton?

555
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,925
Didn't you tell me your
wife was going to take Hank

556
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:42,594
right straight back
to the hotel?

557
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:43,762
I thought so, yes.

558
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:44,804
Well, call her up.

559
00:37:44,888 --> 00:37:46,765
Somebody just called me
and threatened me about Hank.

560
00:37:46,848 --> 00:37:50,059
Go on. Call her up.
See if he's all right.

561
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,237
Hotel Mamounia?

562
00:38:16,753 --> 00:38:18,713
My wife doesn't answer.

563
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:26,179
Concierge?

564
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:48,701
What's your room number?

565
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:51,204
Four fourteen.

566
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:08,346
I can't believe it.

567
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:10,014
She hasn't come
back yet?

568
00:39:10,098 --> 00:39:12,225
At least nobody's
seen her.

569
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:16,980
All right, now you
go back to the hotel.

570
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:21,609
And see if you can
find out What's going on.

571
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:23,236
It's so unlike my wife.

572
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:26,614
I'll take care of the police
and join you as soon as I can.

573
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:30,827
Look here. Don't worry. It's probably
some stupid misunderstanding.

574
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:34,163
If I find anything out before you
get back, I'll telephone you here.

575
00:39:34,247 --> 00:39:35,290
Just don't waste
any time.

576
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:36,833
Good-bye.

577
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:45,884
Who was it, Ben?

578
00:39:46,426 --> 00:39:51,472
It was the concierge
at the hotel.

579
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:55,852
He found out we were
being held by the police.

580
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:58,062
He just called up to see if
there was anything he could do.

581
00:39:58,146 --> 00:39:59,647
That's very nice of him.

582
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:01,566
Yes, I thought so.

583
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:04,110
I told him if we weren't
back there in 15 minutes,

584
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:07,906
for him to call the American
Consulate at Casablanca.

585
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:13,077
But, <i>monsieur,</i> if you had
only told me in the first place

586
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:15,413
that you wished to
consult with yourconsuL

587
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:17,165
Yeah, yeah.
Come on, Jo.

588
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,876
There is just one
small formality.

589
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:22,921
I must request you to sign
a statement of the facts.

590
00:40:23,004 --> 00:40:24,714
If it doesn't take
too long, of course.

591
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:27,550
But a moment.
I will send for a typist.

592
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:37,101
Ben?

593
00:40:38,186 --> 00:40:39,437
Yeah?

594
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,607
Ben, aren't you going to
let me see the message?

595
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,192
I don't...

596
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,613
I don't think
I should.

597
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:50,448
Darling, I'm not
the police inspector.

598
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:53,868
I'm your wife, and I
think that I should see it.

599
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:06,714
Ben, why didn't you
give this to the police?

600
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:07,799
Because I didn't want to.

601
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:09,092
But, Ben,
a man's life...

602
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:10,885
Is at stake.
Yeah, I know.

603
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:14,097
I just... I don't know
what's the right thing to do.

604
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:19,769
Look, I think we should
go back to the hotel,

605
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:22,271
pick up Hank, and get out
of here as quickly as we can.

606
00:41:22,355 --> 00:41:23,481
Maybe.

607
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:24,774
Darling,
think about Hank.

608
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:26,150
What a terrible thing
this is for him,

609
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:29,112
seeing a man murdered
right before his eyes.

610
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:30,989
It's a horrible shock
to a little boy.

611
00:41:31,072 --> 00:41:32,156
I know.

612
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,284
Why don't you take that note,
give it to the American Consulate?

613
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:37,662
And let's not get any
more involved, please.

614
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:53,011
Why don't you get the key?
I'll take care of the driver.

615
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:54,554
All right.

616
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:04,856
Say, you know
a Mrs. Drayton?

617
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:06,858
English lady.
That's right.

618
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,526
Did you see her coming
from the marketplace

619
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:10,695
any time in
the last hour or so?

620
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:11,738
No, sir.

621
00:42:11,821 --> 00:42:14,699
Now, wait a minute. You
understand this is very important.

622
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:17,410
She had a little boy
with her, my little boy.

623
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:19,037
No, sir.

624
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,705
Well, what about
Mr. Drayton?

625
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:22,790
Mr. Drayton checked out.

626
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,793
He what?
Checked out.

627
00:42:25,877 --> 00:42:26,878
But he couldn't have.

628
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:28,004
Yes, sir, he did.

629
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:31,340
No, Mr. Drayton, the Englishman
with the horn-rimmed glasses.

630
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:33,426
Yes, sir.
He checked out.

631
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:44,479
I don't know
about you, but I'm exhausted.

632
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:47,565
IguesslWIcaH
Mrs. Drayton.

633
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:49,067
Tell her we're back.
She can bring up Hank.

634
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:51,069
Just hold that
call a minute, Jo.

635
00:42:51,152 --> 00:42:53,571
Why?
Because I asked you to!

636
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:58,451
Ben, are we about to
have our monthly fight?

637
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:02,663
I hope not.

638
00:43:02,747 --> 00:43:05,249
Well, then stop
acting like that.

639
00:43:06,084 --> 00:43:08,836
I merely said I was
going to call Mrs. Drayton.

640
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,839
Just a minute.
Wait a minute.

641
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:15,426
Just a minute.
Just a minute.

642
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:17,804
I want you to take
these. They'll relax you.

643
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:21,140
Relax me?
I'm so relaxed I'm tired.

644
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:23,518
I think maybe
you need them.

645
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,269
These are for you, Jo.
Now, come on.

646
00:43:25,353 --> 00:43:26,938
I'm the doctor.
Here.

647
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:28,022
Ben.

648
00:43:28,106 --> 00:43:31,734
Jo, you know what happens
when you get excited and nervous.

649
00:43:31,818 --> 00:43:33,277
Now, here.
Do me a favor.

650
00:43:33,361 --> 00:43:35,988
Six months ago, you told
me I took too many pills.

651
00:43:36,072 --> 00:43:38,699
Six months ago, you
weren't a witness to a murder.

652
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:41,619
Now, you've been excited.
You've been talking a blue streak.

653
00:43:41,702 --> 00:43:42,787
You've been walking
around in circles.

654
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:43,830
Ihaven%!

655
00:43:43,913 --> 00:43:48,793
Jo, I make my living knowing when
and how to administer medicine.

656
00:43:48,876 --> 00:43:51,796
Now I know you'll feel better if you
take these. Why fight me on this?

657
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:53,256
All right, you don't
think you will feel better.

658
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:55,299
I'll make a deal
with you.

659
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:57,176
We'll make a deal.
What is this?

660
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:59,387
Well, there's something
about this Louis Bernard,

661
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:01,639
and the police station,
and this whole spy business

662
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:03,516
I haven't told you yet.
What?

663
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,643
Here's the price of
curiosity. What is it?

664
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:08,729
Come on. Come on.
There's one way of finding out.

665
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:16,320
All right, Dr. McKenna. I'm
now relaxed and listening.

666
00:44:16,404 --> 00:44:20,658
Well, there's been something
strange about this whole thing

667
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:22,076
from the very beginning.

668
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,329
Now it wasn't any accident
that Louis Bernard came up to us,

669
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:29,292
and helped us on the bus,
and started up a conversation.

670
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:30,418
You were right about him.

671
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:32,003
You see there?

672
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:33,796
I know. I know.
That's what I said.

673
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:36,507
You were right about him.
He was strange.

674
00:44:36,591 --> 00:44:40,386
Yes, I know all that. But
what were you going to tell me?

675
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:44,348
He started to talk to us, and
the reason he started to talk to us

676
00:44:44,432 --> 00:44:46,017
was 'cause he was
on the lookout

677
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,643
for a suspicious
married couple.

678
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:51,022
There's nothing very
suspicious-looking about us, is there?

679
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:54,984
No, because he was wrong. It
was a different married couple.

680
00:44:57,278 --> 00:44:58,905
And he was killed
before he found them?

681
00:44:58,988 --> 00:45:02,366
No, he found them.
He found them, all right.

682
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:05,369
It was in the restaurant
where we had dinner last night.

683
00:45:05,453 --> 00:45:08,873
And that's one of the
reasons he was killed.

684
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:11,375
You'll be telling me next
it's Mr. and Mrs. Drayton.

685
00:45:11,918 --> 00:45:13,794
That's who it was, Jo.

686
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:18,716
Ben, if this is your idea of a
joke, it's not a very funny one.

687
00:45:22,011 --> 00:45:23,221
I think I'll lie down.

688
00:45:23,304 --> 00:45:25,097
Now, listen to me.
Jo.

689
00:45:26,349 --> 00:45:29,227
Now, listen to me
very carefully.

690
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:31,979
That phone call at
the police station,

691
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:34,774
that wasn't the concierge
at the hotel.

692
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:37,777
That was a man with a
foreign voice, and he told me

693
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,862
if I mentioned one
single word of What

694
00:45:39,946 --> 00:45:41,864
Louis Bernard told me
in the marketplace,

695
00:45:41,948 --> 00:45:44,033
that something
would happen to Hank.

696
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:46,160
Hank? Why Hank?

697
00:45:46,494 --> 00:45:48,079
They've taken him away.

698
00:45:50,331 --> 00:45:53,042
But Mrs. Drayton brought
him back to the hotel.

699
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:56,420
Mrs. Drayton never got back to
the hotel, and neither did Hank.

700
00:45:56,504 --> 00:45:58,172
But Mr. Drayton...
Listen, Jo.

701
00:45:58,256 --> 00:46:01,884
Mr. Drayton checked out
of the hotel 40 minutes ago.

702
00:46:01,968 --> 00:46:03,886
Now, come on, Jo.
Now, sit down.

703
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:06,430
I could kill you! You gave
me sedatives!

704
00:46:06,514 --> 00:46:07,515
Jo, sit down.

705
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:09,767
You did! Let go!

706
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,060
Why didn't you tell me?

707
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:12,853
I wasn't sure
until now.

708
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:14,647
You did! You did!

709
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,190
Jo, please! Please!

710
00:46:16,274 --> 00:46:18,859
Let go of me! Let go!

711
00:46:18,943 --> 00:46:20,278
Ben!

712
00:46:20,361 --> 00:46:22,446
Lie down, Jo.
Lie down, Jo.

713
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:23,739
Ben, let me find my baby!

714
00:46:23,823 --> 00:46:24,949
Please.

715
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:26,909
Dear God!

716
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:30,204
I want my boy!

717
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:31,289
Jo, please.

718
00:46:31,372 --> 00:46:35,209
Please! Please.
Where is he, Ben? Jo.

719
00:46:38,963 --> 00:46:42,383
Forgive me, Jo.
Forgive me.

720
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:40,941
There's still no
word of him, Jo.

721
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:44,695
The Draytons are
definitely gone.

722
00:47:44,779 --> 00:47:47,448
The register in the hotel
says they came from London.

723
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:51,077
Drayton told the concierge
he was a college professor.

724
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:53,913
I don't think there's
anything we can do here, Jo.

725
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:56,290
I can't bring the
police in on this thing.

726
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:58,667
I'd even thought of
taking that chance.

727
00:47:58,751 --> 00:48:01,587
But the minute they connect
Hank's disappearance

728
00:48:01,670 --> 00:48:04,048
with Louis Bernard's
murder,

729
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:05,800
then the first
thing they'll do

730
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:07,968
is make me tell them
what Louis Bernard

731
00:48:08,052 --> 00:48:09,387
whispered to me
in the marketplace.

732
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:12,723
That won't do
Hank any good.

733
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,684
I'm going to London.

734
00:48:15,768 --> 00:48:19,605
The Draytons had a private
airplane. I found that out.

735
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:22,608
That's how they
got Hank out of here.

736
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:26,821
It could land anyplace. No
trouble with passports or anything.

737
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:28,823
So we're going to
London to find him.

738
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:37,164
Jo, now listen to me.
This is what Bernard said.

739
00:48:37,248 --> 00:48:40,584
"A man, a statesman, is
to be killed, assassinated,

740
00:48:40,668 --> 00:48:42,962
"in London.
Soon, very soon.

741
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:47,174
"Tell them in London
to try Ambrose Chappell."

742
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:49,093
That's the fella
we've got to find.

743
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:50,594
And if he knows
anything about this,

744
00:48:50,678 --> 00:48:54,098
I'm gonna offer him every
penny I have to get Hank back.

745
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:57,268
The Chappell guy's our only
hope. You understand that, Jo?

746
00:48:57,351 --> 00:49:00,187
Now, I've got a car
waiting downstairs.

747
00:49:00,271 --> 00:49:04,316
I've paid the hotel bill. We
get packed, we'll be all set.

748
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,860
Honey?

749
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:13,075
We don't have much time. You'll
have to get up and start getting ready.

750
00:49:13,159 --> 00:49:14,577
Please, Jo.

751
00:49:16,579 --> 00:49:17,788
Please, Jo.

752
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:42,938
Would you just wait, sir,
for the press photographers?

753
00:49:43,022 --> 00:49:44,356
Will you come
this way, madam?

754
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,817
Jo, darling,
love from the fan club!

755
00:49:48,569 --> 00:49:50,654
How could they
remember me so well, Ben?

756
00:49:50,738 --> 00:49:52,740
It's been four years
since I played London.

757
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:55,868
You're the kind of gal
they don't forget.

758
00:49:56,660 --> 00:50:00,206
Who told them we were
coming? Ben, you didn't.

759
00:50:00,289 --> 00:50:03,375
All I did was wire your friends,
the Parnells, to get us hotel rooms.

760
00:50:03,459 --> 00:50:05,002
I never figured on
anything like this.

761
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,427
Dr. and Mrs. McKenna,

762
00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:17,056
I'm Inspector Edington of the
Criminal Investigation Department.

763
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:20,518
As things are, there's no need
for you to go through the Customs.

764
00:50:20,601 --> 00:50:22,228
Come this way.

765
00:50:24,605 --> 00:50:25,940
How about
a photo, Jo?

766
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:27,316
Hi, Jo!

767
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:34,323
This way, please.

768
00:50:35,074 --> 00:50:38,577
We want Jo!
We want Jo! We want Jo! We want Jo!

769
00:50:38,661 --> 00:50:40,287
We want Jo! We want Jo!

770
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:43,707
This is Mr. Woburn.
Dr. and Mrs. McKenna.

771
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:45,042
How do you do?
How do you do?

772
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:46,627
What do you people
want with us?

773
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:48,754
Mr. Buchanan would like to
have a chat with you inside.

774
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:50,256
Who's Mr. Buchanan?

775
00:50:50,339 --> 00:50:52,591
Special Branch,
Scotland Yard.

776
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:03,894
This is Mr. Buchanan.
Dr. and Mrs. McKenna.

777
00:51:03,978 --> 00:51:06,522
How do you do?
Thank you, Woburn.

778
00:51:07,273 --> 00:51:09,149
Do sit down,
won't you?

779
00:51:10,818 --> 00:51:12,486
Let me say at once
that we're shocked

780
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:14,863
that your son was taken
from you in Marrakech,

781
00:51:14,947 --> 00:51:17,199
and deeply sympathetic.

782
00:51:17,283 --> 00:51:18,242
Do you know
where he is?

783
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:19,743
Have you heard anything
about our boy?

784
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:22,204
I only wish I could give
you some cheerful news,

785
00:51:22,288 --> 00:51:25,874
but we might find him quite
soon indeed if we work together.

786
00:51:26,834 --> 00:51:29,878
Bernard the Frenchman was
sent to Morocco at our request

787
00:51:29,962 --> 00:51:33,007
to check up on an
assassination plot here in London.

788
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:37,344
You know, a good agent
keeps on staking his life.

789
00:51:37,428 --> 00:51:38,554
He doesn't always win.

790
00:51:39,013 --> 00:51:41,223
Bernard reckoned you
were a man to trust.

791
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:43,601
He relied on you
to come to us.

792
00:51:43,684 --> 00:51:47,021
Those people kidnapped your
boy in order to keep your mouth shut.

793
00:51:49,023 --> 00:51:50,357
That's right, isn't it?

794
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:53,944
No, I think they
took him for money.

795
00:51:54,028 --> 00:51:56,071
Then why didn't you go straight
to your consulate in Casablanca?

796
00:51:56,155 --> 00:51:58,073
Why did you come
to London?

797
00:51:58,157 --> 00:51:59,199
Well, I...

798
00:51:59,283 --> 00:52:00,492
Mr. Buchanan...
No, no.

799
00:52:00,576 --> 00:52:02,620
You're convinced that these
people brought your son to London.

800
00:52:02,703 --> 00:52:05,831
You're convinced that you
can find him off your own bat.

801
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:08,208
You can't.
It's impossible.

802
00:52:08,709 --> 00:52:11,795
But with the help we can
give you, there's a chance,

803
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:13,047
a really good chance.

804
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:15,049
But they told us
not to say anything.

805
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:18,344
Anything you tell me will be in
the most absolute confidence.

806
00:52:18,427 --> 00:52:20,304
Yes, that may
be true, but...

807
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:23,307
Your son is the trump
card these people hold.

808
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:25,267
He's perfectly safe
for the moment.

809
00:52:25,351 --> 00:52:26,810
And when they've
done what they want,

810
00:52:26,894 --> 00:52:28,479
they'll let him go.
Is that the idea?

811
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:30,481
Are we supposed to
just sit here and wait?

812
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:31,940
No, Mrs. McKenna.

813
00:52:32,024 --> 00:52:36,820
If they consider your boy a
nuisance afterwards, I'm afraid...

814
00:52:36,904 --> 00:52:40,157
There's no need for you to
try and scare us, Mr. Buchanan.

815
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:43,410
That's exactly what I am
trying to do, scare you.

816
00:52:44,203 --> 00:52:48,123
I'm trying to prevent a man
being murdered here in London.

817
00:52:48,207 --> 00:52:50,209
If you don't tell
me all you know,

818
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:53,128
you become an accessory
before the fact of murder.

819
00:52:53,212 --> 00:52:55,297
Ben, what can we
do by ourselves?

820
00:52:55,381 --> 00:52:57,675
Now, wait a minute.
Now, wait just a minute.

821
00:52:57,758 --> 00:52:59,510
You've been working
on the wrong McKenna.

822
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:02,388
Louis Bernard talked to me. He
didn't talk to my Wife, you know.

823
00:53:02,471 --> 00:53:03,555
Then you tell me.

824
00:53:03,639 --> 00:53:05,516
He was a Frenchman.
He spoke to me in French,

825
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:08,477
and I don't understand a
single word of the language!

826
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:10,562
Ben, maybe they could
find those people and Hank.

827
00:53:10,646 --> 00:53:12,523
Maybe. Maybe's not
good enough for me.

828
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:14,400
And I don't think it ought to
be good enough for you either.

829
00:53:14,483 --> 00:53:16,193
You act as if you're the only
one who's concerned about...

830
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:17,861
Honey, honey, I
didn't mean it that way.

831
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:20,322
We made up our minds what
we're gonna do about this thing.

832
00:53:20,406 --> 00:53:23,200
Now let's try
and stick to it.

833
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:26,662
I'm sorry,
Mr. Buchanan,

834
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:30,874
we'd like to cooperate with you
on this thing, but we just can't.

835
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:33,419
Well,
I've got a son of my own.

836
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:35,921
I don't know What I'd do.

837
00:53:37,256 --> 00:53:38,674
Excuse me.

838
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:49,727
Telephone call for you,
Mrs. McKenna.

839
00:53:51,687 --> 00:53:55,566
Put the telephone call for Mrs.
McKenna through here, please.

840
00:54:02,614 --> 00:54:03,615
Hello.

841
00:54:03,699 --> 00:54:04,783
<i><i>Mrs. McKenna?</i></i>

842
00:54:04,867 --> 00:54:06,076
Yes?

843
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:08,954
<i>This is Mrs. Drayton.
Do you remember me?</i>

844
00:54:09,413 --> 00:54:11,331
Mrs. Drayton.

845
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:14,209
Where is our son?
Where have you got him?

846
00:54:16,879 --> 00:54:21,008
<i>He's here with me. You
mustn't worry about him, really.</i>

847
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:23,218
Where's our son?
Where have you got him?

848
00:54:23,302 --> 00:54:25,721
<i>I expect you'd like to
speak to him, wouldn't you?</i>

849
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:28,015
Yes, please! Please.

850
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:32,144
Hank! Hello, Hank!

851
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:33,812
<i>Just a minute.</i>

852
00:54:38,192 --> 00:54:40,736
<i>Mommy?
Mommy, is that you?</i>

853
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:43,530
Hank, darling,
are you really all right?

854
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:49,286
<i>I'm a little scared, Mommy,
but I'm all right, I guess.</i>

855
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:52,706
<i>I miss you, Mommy.
I miss you so much!</i>

856
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:57,961
Here. Hank. Hank, this
is Daddy.

857
00:54:58,045 --> 00:54:59,463
<i>Is Mommy crying?</i>

858
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:01,256
Now, Hank, listen to me.

859
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:04,551
Where are you?
Where are you?

860
00:55:05,844 --> 00:55:08,180
<i>I didn't mean to
make her cry, Daddy,</i>

861
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:11,058
<i>but I'm scared,
and I want to see her.</i>

862
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:15,479
Hank, son, now listen. Tell me
where you are. Where are you?

863
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:18,482
<i>Welbeck eight...</i>

864
00:55:18,607 --> 00:55:19,817
Yeah?

865
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:22,402
Eight. Go on, Hank.

866
00:55:23,821 --> 00:55:25,113
Hank!

867
00:55:38,377 --> 00:55:40,462
Ben, he was so scared.

868
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:49,680
It was a London
telephone exchange.

869
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:51,890
Public call box.
West One.

870
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:56,395
Do I have to say any
more? Come on, dear.

871
00:55:56,478 --> 00:55:58,564
You may change
your minds.

872
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:01,483
If you do,

873
00:56:03,777 --> 00:56:05,779
this number
will find me.

874
00:56:11,577 --> 00:56:15,998
<i>Baggage and
airport service for 552 from Paris...</i>

875
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:26,383
Everything all right,
sir? Yeah, yeah.

876
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:28,343
Your room key, sir.
Thank you.

877
00:56:28,427 --> 00:56:30,971
Here.

878
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:33,223
Thank you, sir.
There you are.

879
00:56:33,307 --> 00:56:36,393
It's from the Parnells.
"Welcome home, Jo.

880
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:40,522
"Look forward to seeing your
family, especially the little one."

881
00:56:51,742 --> 00:56:54,953
"With love, from Jan and
Cindy." That's very nice.

882
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:05,756
"Ambrose Chappell."
There he is, big as life.

883
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:12,471
"61 Burdett Street, Camden
Town. Gulliver 6198."

884
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:14,473
What are you
going to say?

885
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:16,433
I'm gonna tell him
I'll keep my mouth shut

886
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:19,478
and offer him all the
money we have for Hank.

887
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:21,647
Operator?

888
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:27,319
Operator,
I want Gulliver 6198.

889
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:30,572
|'|| get it.

890
00:57:33,533 --> 00:57:36,036
Jo! You look wonderful!
Jo!

891
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:37,913
When we got your Wire,
I couldn't believe it.

892
00:57:37,996 --> 00:57:39,456
What were you doing
down in Morocco?

893
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:40,624
Sightseeing.

894
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:42,834
You're the perfect answer
to what London needs, Jo.

895
00:57:42,918 --> 00:57:45,045
This week's the dullest
thing since my first show.

896
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:47,130
Ambrose Chappell.

897
00:57:47,214 --> 00:57:48,840
Mr. Ambrose Chappell.

898
00:57:48,924 --> 00:57:51,218
Mr. Conway, I didn't
know you were there.

899
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:54,680
Dr. McKenna. Dr. McKenna.
Welcome to London town, Doctor.

900
00:57:54,763 --> 00:57:58,100
I am sorry. I knew you were
married. But a doctor? How clever.

901
00:57:58,183 --> 00:58:00,310
Especially in such
a psychosomatic business.

902
00:58:00,394 --> 00:58:02,521
Jan, will you
keep quiet?

903
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:04,690
Honey, you wouldn't know
what psychosomatic means.

904
00:58:04,773 --> 00:58:06,483
I do too. It means when your
mind gets sick of your body,

905
00:58:06,566 --> 00:58:08,026
it does something to it.

906
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:10,112
Can't you see the
doctor's trying to telephone?

907
00:58:10,195 --> 00:58:12,781
Not at all. It's just some
business. It's nothing.

908
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:15,283
Business is everything.
Shh!

909
00:58:15,867 --> 00:58:19,454
Hello. Hello?
Ambrose Chappell.

910
00:58:19,955 --> 00:58:22,457
I say, is this
Mr. Ambrose Chappell?

911
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:26,837
Well, my name's McKenna.
Dr. Benjamin McKenna.

912
00:58:29,798 --> 00:58:32,259
I don't think we need to be
quiet. Would you like a drink?

913
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:36,471
I was wondering if you'd be at
your address for a little while.

914
00:58:36,555 --> 00:58:38,348
I'd like to speak to
you for a few minutes.

915
00:58:38,432 --> 00:58:41,059
Yes. Thank you.
I'll be right over.

916
00:58:43,437 --> 00:58:45,105
I'd like all of you
to meet my husband.

917
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:46,690
I've heard so much
about you, Doctor.

918
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:48,066
It's nice to
see you in person.

919
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:49,943
How do you do, sir?
This is Val's wife, Helen.

920
00:58:50,027 --> 00:58:51,028
How do you do?

921
00:58:51,111 --> 00:58:52,362
You look just
like those pictures

922
00:58:52,446 --> 00:58:54,448
Jo had in her dressing
room four years ago.

923
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:55,615
Haven't changed a bit.

924
00:58:55,699 --> 00:58:56,742
Why should he?
He's a doctor.

925
00:58:56,825 --> 00:58:57,909
Probably gets
free hormones.

926
00:58:57,993 --> 00:58:59,036
Yes.

927
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:01,705
I'm Jan Peterson. I sing
almost as well as your wife.

928
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:06,043
And, darling, this is Cindy
Fontaine from Harrisburg, PA.

929
00:59:06,126 --> 00:59:08,837
Harrisburg.
Been back home lately?

930
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:11,715
How can I? They know
me there as Elva McDuff.

931
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:13,633
It doesn't quite fit me
anymore.

932
00:59:13,717 --> 00:59:16,678
Where's your boy? I'd like to
see which one of you he looks like.

933
00:59:16,762 --> 00:59:18,180
He's staying with
some other people

934
00:59:18,263 --> 00:59:20,724
so we could have a
little time by ourselves.

935
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:22,225
What's his name?

936
00:59:22,309 --> 00:59:24,186
Hank.
Henry, really.

937
00:59:24,269 --> 00:59:27,314
Well, I hope he looks
like you and has the doctor's brain.

938
00:59:28,899 --> 00:59:31,234
These flowers are really so
lovely. We thank you very much.

939
00:59:31,318 --> 00:59:33,153
Well, I'll order
some drinks.

940
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:34,738
Okay, but dinner
tonight's on me,

941
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:36,406
a sort of welcome
home for Jo.

942
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:38,200
I wish I could persuade
her to stay a month.

943
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:39,826
I wish I could,
Val, but I can't.

944
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:42,788
I'm terribly sorry, but I have
an appointment I have to keep.

945
00:59:42,871 --> 00:59:44,873
I wonder if you'd order
the drinks, Mr. Parnell.

946
00:59:44,956 --> 00:59:48,210
I'll be back as soon as I
can. Excuse me, please.

947
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:49,336
Ben, please.

948
00:59:49,961 --> 00:59:51,755
Ben, please.
It's got to be done.

949
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:52,923
Take me with you.

950
00:59:53,006 --> 00:59:54,758
No, no, no. I can't.
I won't disappear.

951
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:57,385
For the last time,
please let me go with you.

952
00:59:57,469 --> 00:59:59,262
Honey, two people are
easier to follow than one.

953
00:59:59,346 --> 01:00:00,889
Now we don't want
Buchanan's men on our tracks,

954
01:00:00,972 --> 01:00:02,140
the other people either.

955
01:00:02,224 --> 01:00:05,644
I'm going out through
the service entrance.

956
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:58,316
Yes, sir?
Ambrose Chappell?

957
01:02:58,400 --> 01:02:59,651
Come in.

958
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:09,869
There's a gent
to see you, sir.

959
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:22,465
Good afternoon, sir. I am Ambrose
Chappell. What can I do for you?

960
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:25,218
Well, I...

961
01:03:25,302 --> 01:03:27,887
If you gave me your name,
that might be a start.

962
01:03:27,971 --> 01:03:32,726
Yes, of course. My name is
McKenna. Dr. Benjamin McKenna.

963
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:33,810
I phoned you.

964
01:03:33,893 --> 01:03:34,936
Yes, yes.

965
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:38,690
You are Ambrose Chappell?

966
01:03:39,399 --> 01:03:43,028
Well, I've been Ambrose
Chappell for nearly 71 years.

967
01:03:44,404 --> 01:03:46,239
But I think I understand
your problem.

968
01:03:46,323 --> 01:03:47,949
You do?
Certainly.

969
01:03:48,033 --> 01:03:49,951
It happens all the time.

970
01:03:50,410 --> 01:03:51,828
You expected
someone else.

971
01:03:52,412 --> 01:03:54,664
Just a moment.
Ambrose?

972
01:03:59,002 --> 01:04:01,880
I think this gentleman
wants to talk to us.

973
01:04:07,719 --> 01:04:10,847
Now, Father, why don't
you go and have a nice rest?

974
01:04:12,098 --> 01:04:14,642
I have centuries of rest
ahead of me, thank you.

975
01:04:14,726 --> 01:04:16,478
Good day to you, sir.

976
01:04:17,896 --> 01:04:19,272
Now, what can
I do for you?

977
01:04:19,356 --> 01:04:20,732
I'm Dr. McKenna.

978
01:04:22,984 --> 01:04:24,194
That name mean
anything to you?

979
01:04:24,778 --> 01:04:27,113
No. No, I don't think so.

980
01:04:28,031 --> 01:04:29,574
You've no idea
why I'm here?

981
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:34,871
My dear sir,
Ihaven%the faintest idea.

982
01:04:34,954 --> 01:04:36,414
But your name
was given to me

983
01:04:36,498 --> 01:04:39,250
by someone I happened
to meet in Marrakech.

984
01:04:40,335 --> 01:04:42,003
Yes?
Yes.

985
01:04:42,087 --> 01:04:46,925
Now, I think you know this man,
Louis Bernard, a Frenchman.

986
01:04:47,592 --> 01:04:48,676
Louis Bernard?

987
01:04:49,636 --> 01:04:51,096
Come on. Let's stop
fooling around.

988
01:04:51,179 --> 01:04:53,848
Bernard told me to come
here just before he died.

989
01:04:54,808 --> 01:04:57,852
This man is dead?

990
01:04:57,936 --> 01:04:59,813
You know he's dead
just as well as I do.

991
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:01,815
Now, I've come here with
a business proposition.

992
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:04,526
I don't see how you
can turn it down.

993
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:12,909
Exactly What
had you in mind?

994
01:05:14,828 --> 01:05:15,995
You want to talk here?

995
01:05:16,162 --> 01:05:17,247
Certainly.

996
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:19,749
We have no secrets
from our employees.

997
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:22,585
Okay. Now,
in the first place,

998
01:05:22,669 --> 01:05:25,922
I haven't uttered one word of
what Bernard told me before he died,

999
01:05:26,005 --> 01:05:27,048
and I never will.

1000
01:05:27,132 --> 01:05:30,135
Frankly, I'm not interested
in political intrigue.

1001
01:05:30,218 --> 01:05:33,012
I don't care who you fellows
are gonna kill here in London.

1002
01:05:33,096 --> 01:05:34,514
All I want is that boy,

1003
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:37,267
and I'll take the next
airplane back to America.

1004
01:05:37,684 --> 01:05:40,437
Come on, please.
Listen to me, will you?

1005
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:43,940
Honestly, if money means
anything to you, I'll do...

1006
01:05:44,023 --> 01:05:45,984
Father,
call the police quick.

1007
01:05:46,067 --> 01:05:48,278
Now, sir, I shall we go into
this a little more carefully...

1008
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:49,404
Wait just a minute.

1009
01:05:49,529 --> 01:05:51,489
You told him to call the
police. No, no. No, no.

1010
01:05:51,573 --> 01:05:53,074
What's the idea,
trying to bluff me?

1011
01:05:53,158 --> 01:05:55,118
My dear sir,
there can be no...

1012
01:05:55,201 --> 01:05:56,286
Let me go.

1013
01:05:56,369 --> 01:05:57,370
Are you sure you don't
know Louis Bernard?

1014
01:05:57,454 --> 01:05:58,455
I've never
heard of him.

1015
01:05:58,538 --> 01:05:59,873
You've got no idea
what happened yesterday

1016
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:01,958
in Marrakech or
where my boy is?

1017
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:03,251
Of course not.
Where is he?

1018
01:06:03,334 --> 01:06:05,670
William! Edgar!
Davis! Help!

1019
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:10,300
Now, wait a minute! Wait! All
right, now, hold on. Wait. Listen.

1020
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:12,135
It's obvious I'm
in the wrong place.

1021
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:14,804
Now, all right, let
go of me. Come on.

1022
01:06:17,432 --> 01:06:19,017
Come on. Listen.

1023
01:06:22,145 --> 01:06:23,229
Wait.

1024
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:26,483
Come on.

1025
01:06:28,443 --> 01:06:31,070
I made a mistake.
Now let me go.

1026
01:06:39,787 --> 01:06:41,414
Hold him! Hold him!

1027
01:06:41,498 --> 01:06:43,583
The police are coming.

1028
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:50,423
Hold him.

1029
01:06:56,262 --> 01:06:56,304
He said that no matter how
Bud Flanagan was got up,

1030
01:06:56,304 --> 01:06:58,973
He said that no matter how
Bud Flanagan was got up,

1031
01:06:59,057 --> 01:07:00,350
even if he was
dressed by Hartnell,

1032
01:07:00,433 --> 01:07:03,102
that nobody would ever
believe that he was an aristocrat.

1033
01:07:03,186 --> 01:07:04,521
So I said,

1034
01:07:04,604 --> 01:07:05,980
"Listen, Chris,

1035
01:07:06,064 --> 01:07:09,567
"why don't you take William
Hickey's column out of the paper?"

1036
01:07:09,651 --> 01:07:13,279
Jo? Jo, what's become of that
unpredictable husband of yours?

1037
01:07:13,363 --> 01:07:15,198
He's been gone
over an hour now.

1038
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:17,575
He went to see some man.
What was it? Church?

1039
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:20,119
No. No, it was Chappell.

1040
01:07:27,627 --> 01:07:30,129
It's not a man.
It's a place.

1041
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:35,843
It's Ambrose Chapel!

1042
01:07:36,553 --> 01:07:38,304
Val, do they list
chapels in the directory?

1043
01:07:38,388 --> 01:07:39,389
Let's take a look.

1044
01:07:39,472 --> 01:07:41,391
Please help me find it.

1045
01:07:42,267 --> 01:07:47,313
Let's see. Here we are.
Ambrose. Here we have a chap...

1046
01:07:47,397 --> 01:07:50,567
Ambrose Chapel,
17 Ambrose Street West Two.

1047
01:07:50,650 --> 01:07:52,193
17 Ambrose Street,
West Two.

1048
01:07:52,277 --> 01:07:54,112
17 Ambrose Street,
West Two.

1049
01:07:55,363 --> 01:07:56,990
17 Ambrose Street.

1050
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:02,620
Look, darlings, I have
to go. I'm very sorry.

1051
01:08:02,704 --> 01:08:05,290
Have another drink, and
I'll be back as soon as I can.

1052
01:08:05,373 --> 01:08:08,001
And explain to Ben when
he comes in, would you?

1053
01:08:08,126 --> 01:08:09,335
Explain what?
Explain what?

1054
01:08:25,852 --> 01:08:27,478
Look, there's something
weird going on here,

1055
01:08:27,562 --> 01:08:28,605
and I can't
quite follow it.

1056
01:08:28,688 --> 01:08:30,106
Let's try to figure
the whole thing out.

1057
01:08:30,189 --> 01:08:31,608
First of all, there
was a man named...

1058
01:08:31,691 --> 01:08:32,692
Ambrose Chappell.

1059
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:34,235
And Ben dashed
off to see him.

1060
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:37,280
Then Jo said it wasn't a man
but a place, and she dashed off.

1061
01:08:37,363 --> 01:08:40,658
Don't mention it again,
darling, or I might dash off.

1062
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:42,702
Ooh! What a temptation.
Can you fathom it, though?

1063
01:08:42,785 --> 01:08:44,454
It's probably some
new American gag.

1064
01:08:44,537 --> 01:08:45,997
I'll have to ask
Danny about it.

1065
01:08:48,625 --> 01:08:50,293
Well, hello again.

1066
01:08:51,878 --> 01:08:53,630
I'm awfully sorry
I had to rush off,

1067
01:08:53,713 --> 01:08:55,381
but it was something
that had to be done.

1068
01:08:55,465 --> 01:08:57,592
Boy,
I can use this.

1069
01:08:58,593 --> 01:09:01,471
Thank you.
Well, I...

1070
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:04,015
Where's Jo? She's
gone to Ambrose Chapel.

1071
01:09:04,098 --> 01:09:05,475
I just came
from there.

1072
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:06,934
Hey, not your
Ambrose Chappell.

1073
01:09:07,018 --> 01:09:09,812
It isn't a he. It's
an it, a building.

1074
01:09:09,896 --> 01:09:12,440
She just left
20 minutes ago.

1075
01:09:12,523 --> 01:09:14,025
She... What?

1076
01:09:15,234 --> 01:09:17,487
What do you mean?
Where's the address?

1077
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:19,155
I'll look it up again.

1078
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:22,617
What is this? You
say it's a building?

1079
01:09:22,700 --> 01:09:24,327
Yes, here it is.
Ambrose Chapel,

1080
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:26,329
17 Ambrose Street,
Bayswater.

1081
01:09:26,412 --> 01:09:28,164
17 Ambrose Street,
Bayswater.

1082
01:09:31,626 --> 01:09:35,088
Yes? Doctor! Doctor,
come back! It's Jo.

1083
01:09:39,634 --> 01:09:41,010
Jo?
Ben?

1084
01:09:41,094 --> 01:09:42,428
What happened?
Did you find anything?

1085
01:09:42,512 --> 01:09:44,305
No, it was
a wild goose chase.

1086
01:09:44,931 --> 01:09:47,558
Darling, it must be
the chapel. I've found it.

1087
01:09:47,642 --> 01:09:48,851
<i>It's just
a short way from here.</i>

1088
01:09:48,935 --> 01:09:50,603
<i>I know it was crazy
thing to do, but...</i>

1089
01:09:50,687 --> 01:09:53,356
Honey, I know the address.
You wait there. I'll be right over.

1090
01:09:53,439 --> 01:09:54,691
All right,
I'll meet you outside.

1091
01:09:54,774 --> 01:09:56,150
<i>Bye, dear.</i>

1092
01:09:56,234 --> 01:09:57,276
What did you say
that address was again?

1093
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:59,570
17 Ambrose Street,
Bayswater.

1094
01:10:00,488 --> 01:10:02,448
I don't know
how to thank you.

1095
01:10:59,964 --> 01:11:03,676
Three men. You don't know
much about checkers, do you?

1096
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:06,763
You'd better go to bed, dear,
or you'll be overtired.

1097
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:08,848
Can I finish?
I'm winning.

1098
01:11:09,474 --> 01:11:10,516
Yes, finish.

1099
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:13,102
Edna, see he has
some milk and biscuits.

1100
01:11:13,186 --> 01:11:16,230
He'd better be put to sleep again,
honey. I've got to get downstairs.

1101
01:11:16,314 --> 01:11:18,941
No, it's not necessary
tonight.

1102
01:11:19,025 --> 01:11:20,693
You'll sleep, Hank,
won't you?

1103
01:11:20,818 --> 01:11:22,445
I guess so.

1104
01:11:22,528 --> 01:11:24,655
Hurry up if you want
to finish this game.

1105
01:11:24,739 --> 01:11:27,784
Look, it doesn't hurt
to be kind, does it?

1106
01:11:29,702 --> 01:11:33,039
Give me a yell when you
want me to unlock the door.

1107
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:45,718
- Can I come in?
- Yes.

1108
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:14,789
I wish it was
tomorrow.

1109
01:12:14,872 --> 01:12:17,875
That's not a very
orthodox sentiment.

1110
01:12:20,711 --> 01:12:22,463
Before I forget.

1111
01:12:23,464 --> 01:12:25,007
Here you are,
my friend.

1112
01:12:25,091 --> 01:12:30,012
Two tickets for the concert at the
Albert Hall with my compliments.

1113
01:12:30,096 --> 01:12:32,265
Your box is
nicely placed.

1114
01:12:32,348 --> 01:12:35,101
Or should we say,
strategically placed.

1115
01:12:35,852 --> 01:12:37,436
And now, for the
most important part.

1116
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:38,813
What is it?

1117
01:12:38,896 --> 01:12:40,648
A record of
the delightful piece

1118
01:12:40,731 --> 01:12:42,024
they're going to
play this evening.

1119
01:12:42,108 --> 01:12:45,152
Music's less in your
line than marksmanship.

1120
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:47,947
If you listen,
I'm going to play you

1121
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:50,616
the exact moment at
which you can shoot.

1122
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:52,451
So listen carefully.

1123
01:13:02,461 --> 01:13:06,465
We'll have it once more. Listen
for the crash of the cymbals.

1124
01:13:19,353 --> 01:13:21,314
You see?
At such a moment,

1125
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:22,940
your shot will
never be heard.

1126
01:13:23,858 --> 01:13:26,235
Even the listeners
will be undisturbed.

1127
01:13:26,319 --> 01:13:29,697
I think the composer would've
appreciated that, don't you?

1128
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:31,616
No one will know.

1129
01:13:31,699 --> 01:13:34,410
No one except one.

1130
01:13:34,493 --> 01:13:37,246
That's right. If you're
clever, my friend.

1131
01:13:38,247 --> 01:13:40,541
Now, any questions,
musical or otherwise?

1132
01:13:40,625 --> 01:13:41,751
No.

1133
01:13:41,834 --> 01:13:43,419
There's one
comforting thought.

1134
01:13:43,502 --> 01:13:45,671
It happens early
in the evening.

1135
01:13:45,755 --> 01:13:47,298
And I hope
I shan't upset you

1136
01:13:47,381 --> 01:13:50,468
if I tell you you've
only time for one shot.

1137
01:13:50,551 --> 01:13:52,345
If you need another,
the risk is yours.

1138
01:13:52,428 --> 01:13:54,180
I don't take risks.

1139
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:55,681
I'm very glad
to hear that.

1140
01:13:55,765 --> 01:13:58,184
Traipsing all the way
to Marrakech for you,

1141
01:13:58,267 --> 01:13:59,852
I should like you
to do me credit.

1142
01:14:01,354 --> 01:14:03,314
Your distinguished target
is already on his way.

1143
01:14:03,397 --> 01:14:06,859
There's a car waiting for you
downstairs in the back entrance.

1144
01:14:07,526 --> 01:14:09,570
You're to pick up
a Miss Benson on the way.

1145
01:14:09,654 --> 01:14:12,281
She'll be your
companion in the box.

1146
01:14:12,365 --> 01:14:16,118
She'll lend you an air of
respectability if that's possible.

1147
01:14:17,244 --> 01:14:19,956
Will you have
the money when I return?

1148
01:14:21,707 --> 01:14:22,875
Don't you trust me?

1149
01:14:24,585 --> 01:14:26,754
What is your
English proverb?

1150
01:14:26,837 --> 01:14:29,507
"A wolf in
sheep's clothing."

1151
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:33,427
A very clever disguise,
I must say.

1152
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:38,516
I think you'd better be going. It's
impolite to be late for a concert.

1153
01:14:39,141 --> 01:14:44,146
And it would be awkward if they made
you wait until the first item was over.

1154
01:14:44,230 --> 01:14:46,482
Will you show our friend
down to the car, my dear?

1155
01:14:46,565 --> 01:14:47,817
Yes, of course.

1156
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:49,860
I'm sorry you have to
sneak out by the back way,

1157
01:14:49,944 --> 01:14:53,072
but we must preserve
a respectable front.

1158
01:15:45,082 --> 01:15:46,125
There it is.

1159
01:15:48,586 --> 01:15:52,882
Yeah. You just may have
hit it right on the nose.

1160
01:15:52,965 --> 01:15:55,926
And you can't be farther wrong
than I was with my Ambrose Chappell.

1161
01:15:56,010 --> 01:15:57,178
Come on, let's go.

1162
01:15:57,261 --> 01:15:59,055
Ben, should we get
some help from the police?

1163
01:15:59,138 --> 01:16:03,059
No, honey, please. Let's take
a crack at this alone. Come on.

1164
01:17:01,117 --> 01:17:02,743
Ben.
Shh, shh.

1165
01:17:12,211 --> 01:17:18,175
<i>This is just
another wild goose chase</i>

1166
01:17:19,677 --> 01:17:21,637
<i>Let's wait</i>

1167
01:17:22,221 --> 01:17:26,892
<i>And look around</i>

1168
01:17:32,857 --> 01:17:39,613
<i>Look who's coming
down the aisle</i>

1169
01:19:19,171 --> 01:19:23,092
The subject of my address to
you this evening is adversity.

1170
01:19:24,385 --> 01:19:27,137
The average life,
yours and mine,

1171
01:19:27,263 --> 01:19:30,015
is often harassed
and perplexed

1172
01:19:30,099 --> 01:19:34,937
by disappointments and by
cruelties beyond our control.

1173
01:19:35,688 --> 01:19:40,442
Now, strangely enough, it is often
these things beyond our control...

1174
01:19:40,526 --> 01:19:42,945
That's
Buchanan's phone number.

1175
01:19:43,028 --> 01:19:47,241
You go out, call him up, tell him
to surround this place with police.

1176
01:19:47,324 --> 01:19:48,284
What if he asks...

1177
01:19:48,367 --> 01:19:50,244
Tell him anything.

1178
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:55,040
This is the time. I'm sure
Hank's around here someplace.

1179
01:19:57,459 --> 01:19:59,211
But I don't want to
leave you. I know. I know.

1180
01:19:59,295 --> 01:20:03,590
I don't know how else to
do it, honey. You go on now.

1181
01:20:08,595 --> 01:20:11,807
...and therefore the
goodness of all mankind.

1182
01:20:21,608 --> 01:20:26,196
Few of us pause to consider how
life's adversities work in our behalf

1183
01:20:26,280 --> 01:20:28,824
to make better
men and women of us.

1184
01:20:28,907 --> 01:20:32,161
But I think we should
pause, and pause now,

1185
01:20:32,244 --> 01:20:34,830
to do a little
stocktaking,

1186
01:20:34,913 --> 01:20:38,917
to look into our own hearts and
lives and see what we find there.

1187
01:20:41,086 --> 01:20:44,089
Therefore, instead of
continuing the service,

1188
01:20:44,173 --> 01:20:48,802
I think we should all return to
our homes for private meditation,

1189
01:20:48,886 --> 01:20:51,722
remembering how little
we have to complain of

1190
01:20:51,805 --> 01:20:54,558
and how much to
be grateful for.

1191
01:20:54,641 --> 01:20:58,687
Next week, I shall discuss
the fruits of our meditations.

1192
01:20:58,771 --> 01:21:02,691
Until then, my blessing upon
each and every one of you.

1193
01:22:09,174 --> 01:22:11,677
Well, this is a pleasant
surprise, Doctor.

1194
01:22:12,344 --> 01:22:13,929
Where's my boy,
Drayton?

1195
01:22:14,012 --> 01:22:15,556
He's upstairs.

1196
01:22:15,639 --> 01:22:18,767
As a matter of fact, you've come just
in time to help my wife with his food.

1197
01:22:18,851 --> 01:22:22,563
It seems Hank doesn't care
very much for our English cooking.

1198
01:22:22,646 --> 01:22:24,106
What do you want?

1199
01:22:24,189 --> 01:22:27,818
I'll give you money. I'll keep my
mouth shut. All I want is my boy.

1200
01:22:28,444 --> 01:22:29,987
And what about
your wife?

1201
01:22:30,070 --> 01:22:33,031
Did she go outside just
to get a breath of fresh air?

1202
01:22:33,115 --> 01:22:35,451
Come on. Tell me what
you want. I'll do anything.

1203
01:22:35,534 --> 01:22:39,455
All right, you'll see
your boy all in good time.

1204
01:22:39,997 --> 01:22:43,000
Hank! Hank McKenna!

1205
01:22:44,209 --> 01:22:47,588
Daddy?
Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!

1206
01:22:47,671 --> 01:22:50,549
I'm here, Daddy! I'm here!

1207
01:23:06,857 --> 01:23:10,110
My husband's in there now watching
them. He sent me out to call you

1208
01:23:10,194 --> 01:23:12,362
so that you could do something
before they get away.

1209
01:23:12,446 --> 01:23:14,406
I'm afraid it isn't quite
as easy as all that.

1210
01:23:14,490 --> 01:23:16,658
Mr. Woburn,
my husband is in that chapel

1211
01:23:16,742 --> 01:23:19,328
waiting for me to
bring help. Now you...

1212
01:23:19,411 --> 01:23:21,079
May I speak to
Mr. Buchanan?

1213
01:23:21,163 --> 01:23:23,874
He told me to call him if I needed
him, and I need him right now.

1214
01:23:23,957 --> 01:23:27,002
I'm awfully sorry. But I simply
can't get in touch with him just now.

1215
01:23:27,085 --> 01:23:30,088
He's gone to a rather important
diplomatic affair at the Albert Hall.

1216
01:23:30,172 --> 01:23:32,466
Well, then call him there!
Please call him.

1217
01:23:32,549 --> 01:23:35,052
He's on his way.
I don't know quite how...

1218
01:23:35,135 --> 01:23:38,263
Mr. Woburn, it isn't a matter
of days. It's a matter of minutes.

1219
01:23:38,347 --> 01:23:40,098
Now, you've got
to send some...

1220
01:23:40,182 --> 01:23:41,850
You've got to send
the police right away!

1221
01:23:41,934 --> 01:23:43,936
<i>Or do I have to go
to Albert Hall myself?</i>

1222
01:23:44,019 --> 01:23:45,479
That won't be necessary.

1223
01:23:45,562 --> 01:23:48,357
I'll have the chapel put
under immediate observation.

1224
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:50,692
By the time you get back,
a police car should be there.

1225
01:23:50,776 --> 01:23:52,027
Please return
to your husband.

1226
01:23:52,110 --> 01:23:55,113
Tell him to come straight out of the
chapel and let the police take over.

1227
01:23:55,197 --> 01:23:56,740
Woburn, Special Branch.
Hold on.

1228
01:23:56,823 --> 01:23:58,367
I must ring off now,
Mrs. McKenna.

1229
01:23:58,450 --> 01:24:00,369
<i>Please believe me. I'll
have everything laid on.</i>

1230
01:24:32,484 --> 01:24:34,444
There's nobody there.

1231
01:24:34,528 --> 01:24:35,654
Are you Mrs. McKenna?

1232
01:24:35,737 --> 01:24:37,197
Yes, but there's
something wrong, Officer.

1233
01:24:37,281 --> 01:24:38,865
That place was full of
people just a few minutes ago,

1234
01:24:38,949 --> 01:24:39,950
and now there's nobody.

1235
01:24:40,033 --> 01:24:41,535
Our orders are to keep
it under observation

1236
01:24:41,618 --> 01:24:43,370
until the Scotland
Yard car arrives.

1237
01:24:43,453 --> 01:24:46,540
But my husband is in there.
There were 30 or 40 people...

1238
01:24:46,623 --> 01:24:47,958
When was this?

1239
01:24:48,041 --> 01:24:50,043
It was no more
than five minutes ago.

1240
01:24:50,127 --> 01:24:51,378
Let's take a look.

1241
01:24:51,461 --> 01:24:53,547
I've tried the door.
It's locked.

1242
01:24:53,630 --> 01:24:55,132
We'll have to
force it open.

1243
01:24:55,215 --> 01:24:57,467
I'm sorry, madam.
We can't break in.

1244
01:24:57,551 --> 01:25:00,012
Requires a search warrant.
It's the law, you see.

1245
01:25:00,095 --> 01:25:01,138
Well, can't we get one?

1246
01:25:01,221 --> 01:25:02,806
That all takes time.

1247
01:25:02,889 --> 01:25:04,850
We'll have a look
around, shall we?

1248
01:25:04,933 --> 01:25:06,018
Matthews,
take the other end.

1249
01:25:06,101 --> 01:25:07,519
All right.

1250
01:25:33,712 --> 01:25:34,755
There's no one there.

1251
01:25:34,838 --> 01:25:36,590
Are you quite certain this
place was full of people

1252
01:25:36,673 --> 01:25:37,924
only a few minutes ago?

1253
01:25:38,008 --> 01:25:41,470
Of course I'm certain. I was there
myself sitting next to my husband.

1254
01:25:41,553 --> 01:25:44,222
He sent me out to
call Scotland Yard.

1255
01:25:46,433 --> 01:25:49,519
Look, I'm afraid it's much
too complicated to explain why.

1256
01:25:49,603 --> 01:25:53,315
We'll just have to sit tight and wait
for the car to arrive from the Yard.

1257
01:25:59,905 --> 01:26:01,657
As far as we can make out,
there's no sign of life.

1258
01:26:01,740 --> 01:26:02,824
<i><i>Report back here.</i></i>

1259
01:26:02,908 --> 01:26:04,743
I see.
Very good, sir.

1260
01:26:04,826 --> 01:26:06,787
Walden, you stand by till
the car arrives from the Yard.

1261
01:26:06,870 --> 01:26:08,705
That's all, Matthews.
You're not leaving?

1262
01:26:08,789 --> 01:26:12,459
Orders, madam. Can we
give you a lift somewhere?

1263
01:26:12,542 --> 01:26:13,835
Yes, take me to
Albert Hall, please.

1264
01:26:13,919 --> 01:26:15,671
I'm afraid the Albert
Hall's a little bit off our beat.

1265
01:26:15,754 --> 01:26:17,381
Suppose we drop you
at the nearest taxi rank?

1266
01:26:17,422 --> 01:26:19,257
All right.

1267
01:27:37,711 --> 01:27:39,045
Wait here.

1268
01:27:45,844 --> 01:27:47,637
They're here.

1269
01:27:47,721 --> 01:27:49,347
Wait till I clear
the kitchen.

1270
01:27:59,775 --> 01:28:03,153
Everybody out! Come on. Into
the corridor. Five minutes only!

1271
01:28:03,236 --> 01:28:04,613
Come on!

1272
01:28:04,696 --> 01:28:08,158
Do as he tells you. Come
on. It'll only take a minute.

1273
01:28:08,241 --> 01:28:10,452
Come on. All of you out.

1274
01:28:10,535 --> 01:28:12,037
Why? Why?

1275
01:28:29,346 --> 01:28:31,223
All right. This way.

1276
01:28:34,392 --> 01:28:36,728
Always something funny
going on at this embassy.

1277
01:28:36,812 --> 01:28:38,730
Bringing people
in secret.

1278
01:28:38,814 --> 01:28:40,649
Give me the Swiss
embassy anytime.

1279
01:28:40,732 --> 01:28:42,818
There's neutrality
for you.

1280
01:30:04,232 --> 01:30:05,775
Please, may I
see the manager?

1281
01:30:05,859 --> 01:30:08,570
I'm sorry, madam. The
manager's on duty in the lobby.

1282
01:30:08,653 --> 01:30:09,696
So is his assistant.

1283
01:30:09,779 --> 01:30:10,780
I must speak
with one of them.

1284
01:30:10,864 --> 01:30:12,115
Which are they?

1285
01:30:12,198 --> 01:30:13,783
Over there somewhere.

1286
01:30:39,059 --> 01:30:41,394
You have a very nice
little boy, <i>madame.</i>

1287
01:30:42,020 --> 01:30:45,315
His safety will depend
upon you tonight.

1288
01:30:45,398 --> 01:30:48,485
Where is he?
Where is he?

1289
01:31:00,372 --> 01:31:01,831
Good evening.

1290
01:31:02,540 --> 01:31:03,708
Is that the
Prime Minister?

1291
01:31:03,792 --> 01:31:05,710
No, that's only
the Ambassador.

1292
01:31:05,794 --> 01:31:08,672
His Prime Minister's the
one with the bald head.

1293
01:31:34,239 --> 01:31:35,615
Your ticket, madam?

1294
01:31:35,699 --> 01:31:37,826
I'm sorry.
I'm looking for someone.

1295
01:41:30,626 --> 01:41:34,088
I saw the gun. He was
pointing it at the Prime Minister.

1296
01:41:34,171 --> 01:41:37,091
He was going to kill him, and
I realized that I had to scream.

1297
01:41:50,980 --> 01:41:52,023
Well, then he
didn't kill him?

1298
01:41:52,106 --> 01:41:55,151
Your wife saved him. It's
only a small flesh wound.

1299
01:41:56,902 --> 01:41:58,988
There they are.
Do please come over

1300
01:41:59,071 --> 01:42:00,865
and let the Prime Minister
thank you personally, would you?

1301
01:42:00,948 --> 01:42:03,367
I'm sure he'd like to.
It won't take very long.

1302
01:42:03,451 --> 01:42:06,579
Would you come along
with me? Don't be nervous.

1303
01:42:15,338 --> 01:42:17,465
Prime Minister,
this is the young lady.

1304
01:42:17,548 --> 01:42:19,800
Dear lady, I'm
forever in your debt.

1305
01:42:19,884 --> 01:42:21,927
This is her
husband.

1306
01:42:22,011 --> 01:42:24,930
I trust you'll permit me to
wait upon you tomorrow.

1307
01:42:25,014 --> 01:42:28,976
And to express to you
the depth of my gratitude.

1308
01:42:29,060 --> 01:42:30,811
It wasn't...

1309
01:42:30,895 --> 01:42:33,522
But it was, my
dear lady. It was.

1310
01:42:34,398 --> 01:42:36,108
Will you excuse us?

1311
01:42:37,652 --> 01:42:39,737
Excuse me,
but I have to go.

1312
01:42:47,995 --> 01:42:50,956
I think Mr. Buchanan
would like a word with you.

1313
01:42:56,921 --> 01:42:58,631
Where's our boy?
Where's Hank?

1314
01:42:58,714 --> 01:43:01,258
We can talk if
you'll come in here.

1315
01:43:04,929 --> 01:43:06,889
So you both knew the time
and the place all along.

1316
01:43:06,972 --> 01:43:08,182
Don't be a fool!

1317
01:43:08,265 --> 01:43:10,226
An odd coincidence,
both of you turning up here.

1318
01:43:10,309 --> 01:43:11,852
Yeah, it's a pity you didn't
contact your assistant.

1319
01:43:11,936 --> 01:43:13,521
He told us both
you were here.

1320
01:43:13,604 --> 01:43:14,689
I beg your pardon?

1321
01:43:14,772 --> 01:43:16,774
We need that help you
offered, Mr. Buchanan.

1322
01:43:19,694 --> 01:43:22,697
Sir, we've questioned the
woman. Said she bought a ticket

1323
01:43:22,780 --> 01:43:24,323
which happened to
place her in the same box

1324
01:43:24,407 --> 01:43:25,908
with the man who
did the shooting.

1325
01:43:25,991 --> 01:43:28,327
Didn't know anything. But
if she does, she isn't talking.

1326
01:43:28,411 --> 01:43:29,412
I'll see her later.

1327
01:43:29,495 --> 01:43:30,663
Very good, sir.

1328
01:43:30,746 --> 01:43:33,749
Please tell me everything
now. Everything.

1329
01:43:33,833 --> 01:43:37,169
There's still plenty of room
for hope, Mrs. McKenna.

1330
01:43:45,594 --> 01:43:47,304
His Excellency
will see you now.

1331
01:44:11,120 --> 01:44:12,913
And that's that,
Isuppose.

1332
01:44:12,997 --> 01:44:15,040
Yes. All right.

1333
01:44:19,211 --> 01:44:22,506
Excuse me, sir. I have
a lot to explain to you.

1334
01:44:23,507 --> 01:44:26,093
Something very
unusual has happened.

1335
01:44:27,720 --> 01:44:30,681
I also have to have the
money to pay the marksman.

1336
01:44:31,140 --> 01:44:35,895
Wouldn't that be superfluous,
considering that he's dead?

1337
01:44:43,027 --> 01:44:47,072
His aim wasn't quite as
good as you led me to expect.

1338
01:44:47,156 --> 01:44:50,743
The target merely received a
slight flesh wound in the arm.

1339
01:44:50,826 --> 01:44:52,703
Worse than useless.

1340
01:44:53,496 --> 01:44:57,625
Then your French friend
panicked, made a fatal crash,

1341
01:44:57,708 --> 01:45:00,044
landing on the floor
of the Albert Hall.

1342
01:45:04,465 --> 01:45:07,009
I don't see how you can
blame me for that, sir.

1343
01:45:07,092 --> 01:45:09,845
He was warmly recommended
by our people in Marrakech.

1344
01:45:09,929 --> 01:45:13,307
I'm glad that you are able
to treat the matter so lightly.

1345
01:45:13,390 --> 01:45:15,810
I'm holding a reception
here this evening.

1346
01:45:15,893 --> 01:45:17,645
In a few moments,
I have to welcome

1347
01:45:17,728 --> 01:45:19,814
our Prime Minister
as my guest of honor

1348
01:45:19,897 --> 01:45:24,193
when I hoped and expected that
he would be totally unable to attend.

1349
01:45:25,653 --> 01:45:28,489
That amuses you,
no doubt.

1350
01:45:28,572 --> 01:45:29,698
I don't know
what to say.

1351
01:45:29,782 --> 01:45:30,908
No.

1352
01:45:33,577 --> 01:45:35,454
But I do.

1353
01:45:35,538 --> 01:45:37,706
You have muddled
everything from the start.

1354
01:45:37,790 --> 01:45:40,209
Taking that child
with you from Marrakech.

1355
01:45:40,292 --> 01:45:43,879
Don't you realize that Americans
dislike having their children stolen?

1356
01:45:44,547 --> 01:45:47,299
How else could I make sure that
McKenna would keep his mouth shut?

1357
01:45:47,383 --> 01:45:50,219
Then to crown it all,
you get cold feet

1358
01:45:50,302 --> 01:45:52,388
and come running
along here to hide,

1359
01:45:52,471 --> 01:45:54,515
bringing the wretched
child with you.

1360
01:45:54,598 --> 01:45:58,018
Don't you see what you've done to
the diplomatic status of this embassy?

1361
01:45:58,102 --> 01:46:00,187
I didn't think.
I only thought we could...

1362
01:46:00,271 --> 01:46:03,065
How are you going to get
the child out of here?

1363
01:46:05,693 --> 01:46:08,320
No difficulty about that,
surely. The car...

1364
01:46:08,404 --> 01:46:12,867
With plainclothes detectives
planted right 'round this building?

1365
01:46:12,950 --> 01:46:15,786
You English intellectuals
will be the death of us all.

1366
01:46:15,870 --> 01:46:17,872
I'll think of something.
Only give me time.

1367
01:46:17,955 --> 01:46:19,623
Time.

1368
01:46:27,506 --> 01:46:32,303
I want the child removed from this
embassy and removed in such a way

1369
01:46:32,386 --> 01:46:37,725
that he won't be able to say
anymore where he has been tonight.

1370
01:46:37,808 --> 01:46:39,184
No!

1371
01:46:43,063 --> 01:46:44,899
I'll see to it.

1372
01:46:44,982 --> 01:46:49,445
Drayton! I trust that nothing
will go wrong this time.

1373
01:46:55,951 --> 01:46:58,203
It would be very
unfortunate for you if...

1374
01:47:00,873 --> 01:47:02,458
Yes, come in.

1375
01:47:04,335 --> 01:47:08,172
Your Excellency, the princess
should be arriving at any moment.

1376
01:47:21,018 --> 01:47:23,103
I recognized him.
He recognized me.

1377
01:47:23,187 --> 01:47:26,357
He tried to get away, made
a jump for it. That was all.

1378
01:47:26,440 --> 01:47:29,276
Trying to liquidate one
of their own big shots.

1379
01:47:29,360 --> 01:47:31,028
I wish they'd stick
to their usual custom

1380
01:47:31,111 --> 01:47:32,321
and do it in
their own country.

1381
01:47:35,115 --> 01:47:36,325
Yes?

1382
01:47:38,702 --> 01:47:40,412
Buchanan speaking.

1383
01:47:44,124 --> 01:47:45,668
Right. Thank you.

1384
01:47:47,169 --> 01:47:48,504
The Draytons are
at the embassy.

1385
01:47:48,587 --> 01:47:49,630
The what?

1386
01:47:49,713 --> 01:47:50,756
How do you know?

1387
01:47:50,839 --> 01:47:54,093
We have means of
finding out from the inside.

1388
01:47:54,176 --> 01:47:55,886
Well, look, if the Draytons
are at the embassy,

1389
01:47:55,970 --> 01:47:57,304
then our boy's
there too.

1390
01:47:57,388 --> 01:47:59,807
You're probably right,
but we can't do anything.

1391
01:47:59,890 --> 01:48:01,642
What do you mean,
you can't do anything?

1392
01:48:01,725 --> 01:48:04,603
Every embassy in a foreign
country has extraterritorial rights.

1393
01:48:04,687 --> 01:48:05,729
What's that?

1394
01:48:05,813 --> 01:48:08,023
As far as we're concerned, this
embassy stands on foreign soil.

1395
01:48:08,107 --> 01:48:11,694
So they can steal kids and
get away with it? What is this?

1396
01:48:11,777 --> 01:48:13,153
We could have
the Foreign Office

1397
01:48:13,237 --> 01:48:15,447
serve a writ on
the Ambassador.

1398
01:48:15,531 --> 01:48:19,034
You know, I'm not responsible for
the complications of international law.

1399
01:48:19,118 --> 01:48:23,747
If only we had some positive
proof that your boy really is in there.

1400
01:48:30,212 --> 01:48:33,215
Say, what's the phone
number of that embassy?

1401
01:48:33,298 --> 01:48:34,800
You got it?

1402
01:48:34,883 --> 01:48:35,926
What are you
thinking about?

1403
01:48:36,010 --> 01:48:37,594
Let me try something.

1404
01:48:37,678 --> 01:48:39,263
Grosvenor 0144.

1405
01:48:39,346 --> 01:48:41,515
Grosvenor 0144,
please.

1406
01:48:42,975 --> 01:48:45,644
That fellow that got shot's
a prime minister, isn't he?

1407
01:48:47,479 --> 01:48:51,608
Hello? Hello. I'd like to speak
to the Prime Minister, please.

1408
01:48:51,692 --> 01:48:53,235
Yeah, yeah. No, look.

1409
01:48:53,318 --> 01:48:56,196
Just tell him the lady that saved
his life would like to speak to him.

1410
01:48:56,280 --> 01:48:58,699
It's very important.
Yeah.

1411
01:48:58,782 --> 01:48:59,867
Ben, what do I say?

1412
01:48:59,950 --> 01:49:02,036
He wanted to visit with
us so he could thank you.

1413
01:49:02,119 --> 01:49:04,705
Tell him you want to come over
to the embassy right away, tonight,

1414
01:49:04,788 --> 01:49:07,541
'cause we're going to leave
London tomorrow. You see?

1415
01:49:07,624 --> 01:49:09,376
Hello? Here you are.

1416
01:49:10,002 --> 01:49:11,003
Hello?

1417
01:49:11,378 --> 01:49:14,631
My dear lady, this is
a charming surprise.

1418
01:49:19,470 --> 01:49:22,139
Delighted.
Delighted, delighted.

1419
01:49:22,222 --> 01:49:25,017
The Ambassador too
would be delighted.

1420
01:49:25,100 --> 01:49:27,644
Any friends of mine
are friends of his.

1421
01:49:31,482 --> 01:49:33,108
He said all right.

1422
01:49:33,859 --> 01:49:35,819
So if he asks you,
we're all set. You see?

1423
01:49:35,903 --> 01:49:36,904
But supposing
they don't?

1424
01:49:36,987 --> 01:49:39,740
Honey, have we ever been to a
party where they didn't ask you?

1425
01:49:39,823 --> 01:49:42,910
Now, your job is to
hold their attention, right?

1426
01:49:47,915 --> 01:49:50,250
Good evening.
It's Dr. and Mrs. McKenna.

1427
01:49:50,334 --> 01:49:52,878
How very nice
to see you.

1428
01:49:52,961 --> 01:49:54,588
The Prime Minister's
waiting for you.

1429
01:49:54,671 --> 01:49:57,091
Do come this way,
please.

1430
01:50:05,015 --> 01:50:06,433
<i>Madame.</i>

1431
01:50:07,184 --> 01:50:08,936
Good evening,
good evening.

1432
01:50:09,019 --> 01:50:10,771
Good evening.

1433
01:50:10,854 --> 01:50:14,691
This is the charming lady who
saved my life at the concert.

1434
01:50:14,775 --> 01:50:17,486
Madam, you saved
the life of the one man

1435
01:50:17,569 --> 01:50:20,322
who's irreplaceable
in our country.

1436
01:50:21,698 --> 01:50:24,618
I hear you are the famous
Jo Conway, <i>madame.</i>

1437
01:50:24,701 --> 01:50:26,411
Yes, I'm Jo Conway.

1438
01:50:26,495 --> 01:50:27,871
Perhaps we might...

1439
01:50:27,955 --> 01:50:30,791
I'm sure my wife would
be delighted to sing for you.

1440
01:50:30,874 --> 01:50:32,292
Wouldn't you, dear?

1441
01:50:32,376 --> 01:50:34,211
Well, it's been
quite some time.

1442
01:50:34,711 --> 01:50:37,381
I beg you, <i>madame.</i>
A tranquil coda

1443
01:50:37,464 --> 01:50:39,758
to conclude
a dramatic evening.

1444
01:50:39,842 --> 01:50:41,218
I'm very flattered.

1445
01:50:42,344 --> 01:50:46,974
Stanis? Would you put up
some chairs? And hurry up, please.

1446
01:50:47,057 --> 01:50:48,475
Ladies and gentlemen,

1447
01:50:48,559 --> 01:50:50,602
the famous Jo Conway
has gladly consented

1448
01:50:50,686 --> 01:50:52,855
to sing a few songs
for us tonight.

1449
01:50:53,856 --> 01:50:58,777
Darling, would you see that the
Prime Minister gets a very good seat?

1450
01:50:58,861 --> 01:51:01,363
Would you like to
come to the piano?

1451
01:51:03,365 --> 01:51:06,410
Would you not like
to sit down, sir?

1452
01:51:06,493 --> 01:51:09,496
No, thank you. I'll
just stand over here.

1453
01:51:25,596 --> 01:51:28,515
<i>When
I was just a little girl</i>

1454
01:51:28,599 --> 01:51:33,478
<i>I asked my mother
what will I be</i>

1455
01:51:33,562 --> 01:51:38,108
<i>Win 1 be pretty?
Will I be rich?</i>

1456
01:51:38,192 --> 01:51:42,529
<i>Here's what she said to me</i>

1457
01:51:42,613 --> 01:51:46,700
<i>Que sera, sera</i>

1458
01:51:47,284 --> 01:51:51,663
<i>Whatever will be, will be</i>

1459
01:51:51,747 --> 01:51:55,709
<i>The future's not ours to see</i>

1460
01:51:55,792 --> 01:51:59,296
<i>Que sera, sera</i>

1461
01:51:59,963 --> 01:52:03,759
<i>What will be, will be</i>

1462
01:52:04,676 --> 01:52:08,222
<i>When I was just
a child in school</i>

1463
01:52:08,305 --> 01:52:12,601
<i>I asked my teacher
what should I try</i>

1464
01:52:12,684 --> 01:52:16,730
<i>Should I paint pictures?
Should I sing songs?</i>

1465
01:52:16,813 --> 01:52:19,816
<i>This was her wise reply</i>

1466
01:52:20,359 --> 01:52:24,655
<i>Que sera, sera</i>

1467
01:52:24,738 --> 01:52:28,992
<i>Whatever will be, will be</i>

1468
01:52:29,076 --> 01:52:33,205
<i>The future's not ours to see</i>

1469
01:52:33,288 --> 01:52:36,708
<i>Que sera, sera</i>

1470
01:52:37,459 --> 01:52:39,628
<i>What will be, will be</i>

1471
01:52:42,798 --> 01:52:46,093
<i>When I grew up
and fell in love</i>

1472
01:52:46,176 --> 01:52:51,431
<i>I asked my sweetheart
what lies ahead</i>

1473
01:52:51,515 --> 01:52:56,645
<i>Will we have rainbows
day after day?</i>

1474
01:52:56,728 --> 01:52:59,606
<i>Here's what my sweetheart said</i>

1475
01:53:00,399 --> 01:53:04,027
<i>Que sera, sera</i>

1476
01:53:04,695 --> 01:53:09,283
<i>Whatever will be, will be</i>

1477
01:53:09,366 --> 01:53:13,078
<i>The future's not ours to see</i>

1478
01:53:13,161 --> 01:53:14,288
<i>Que sera, sera</i>

1479
01:53:14,371 --> 01:53:16,081
That's my mother's voice!

1480
01:53:16,164 --> 01:53:18,125
That's my mother singing!

1481
01:53:18,208 --> 01:53:19,376
What?

1482
01:53:21,211 --> 01:53:22,879
Are you sure, Hank?

1483
01:53:24,131 --> 01:53:25,465
Are you quite sure?

1484
01:53:25,549 --> 01:53:27,426
That's her! I know it!

1485
01:53:29,803 --> 01:53:31,888
What's she doing here?

1486
01:53:46,153 --> 01:53:49,406
Hank, can you
whistle that song?

1487
01:53:50,157 --> 01:53:51,575
I guess so.

1488
01:53:54,036 --> 01:53:55,912
Then go on.
Whistle it.

1489
01:53:55,996 --> 01:53:58,665
Whistle it
as loud as you can.

1490
01:54:09,134 --> 01:54:13,764
<i>Will we have rainbows
day after day?</i>

1491
01:54:14,514 --> 01:54:18,852
<i>Here's what my sweetheart said</i>

1492
01:54:22,939 --> 01:54:27,152
<i>Ever Will</i> be, <i>will</i> be

1493
01:54:27,235 --> 01:54:30,530
<i>The future's not ours to see</i>

1494
01:54:30,614 --> 01:54:33,950
<i>Que sera, sera</i>

1495
01:54:34,034 --> 01:54:38,163
<i>What will be, will be</i>

1496
01:54:38,246 --> 01:54:41,333
<i>Now I have children of my own</i>

1497
01:54:41,416 --> 01:54:46,546
<i>They ask their mother
what will I be</i>

1498
01:54:46,630 --> 01:54:51,802
<i>Win 1 be handsome?
Will I be rich?</i>

1499
01:54:51,885 --> 01:54:57,307
<i>I tell them tenderly</i>

1500
01:54:57,391 --> 01:55:01,937
<i>Que sera, sera</i>

1501
01:55:02,020 --> 01:55:06,358
<i>Whatever will be, will be</i>

1502
01:55:06,441 --> 01:55:10,028
<i>The future's not ours to see</i>

1503
01:55:10,112 --> 01:55:14,408
<i>Que sera, sera</i>

1504
01:55:14,491 --> 01:55:17,327
<i>What will be, will be</i>

1505
01:55:19,621 --> 01:55:22,499
You two wait in the mail
room. I'll bring him down.

1506
01:55:24,584 --> 01:55:25,836
Give me about
five minutes.

1507
01:56:24,895 --> 01:56:26,188
No!

1508
01:56:29,232 --> 01:56:31,234
Daddy!

1509
01:56:33,403 --> 01:56:36,323
Take the boy. Go! But be
quick. You must be quick!

1510
01:56:36,406 --> 01:56:37,657
Come on, son.

1511
01:56:39,075 --> 01:56:40,160
Go on!

1512
01:56:40,160 --> 01:56:40,702
Go on!

1513
01:56:40,827 --> 01:56:42,454
Just a moment,
please.

1514
01:56:42,537 --> 01:56:43,747
Don't touch him.

1515
01:56:48,543 --> 01:56:50,712
I don't think you're gonna
do any shooting, Drayton,

1516
01:56:50,795 --> 01:56:55,217
not with these people
downstairs and the police outside.

1517
01:56:55,300 --> 01:56:58,470
You're not in a very happy
position yourself, you know.

1518
01:56:58,553 --> 01:57:00,096
You've got to
let the boy go!

1519
01:57:00,597 --> 01:57:02,849
Precisely what I'm
thinking, my dear.

1520
01:57:02,933 --> 01:57:07,562
Now I'm sure you're going to be
sensible and help me out of here.

1521
01:57:07,646 --> 01:57:10,106
Don't ask me for help,
you miserable...

1522
01:57:10,190 --> 01:57:14,069
You wouldn't want your father
to get hurt, would you, Hank?

1523
01:57:16,071 --> 01:57:18,573
Now we're going to
walk downstairs together

1524
01:57:18,657 --> 01:57:22,077
quite casually like
three old friends.

1525
01:57:22,160 --> 01:57:23,912
Then we're going to
take a little stroll

1526
01:57:23,995 --> 01:57:26,331
as far as the
nearest taxi rank.

1527
01:57:26,414 --> 01:57:30,001
And I hope there won't be any
emotional scenes on the way down.

1528
01:57:30,835 --> 01:57:32,796
Do as he says, Hank.

1529
01:57:34,464 --> 01:57:36,925
No, the other way.

1530
01:57:37,008 --> 01:57:38,718
Shall we be going?

1531
01:57:38,802 --> 01:57:41,263
All right, start
down the hall, son.

1532
01:57:43,932 --> 01:57:45,767
Don't say anything.

1533
01:58:20,677 --> 01:58:25,640
<i><i>Now it's good-bye</i></i>

1534
01:58:25,724 --> 01:58:32,522
<i>And we're facing
such lonely tomorrows</i>

1535
01:58:34,983 --> 01:58:37,611
<i>So many sunsets</i>

1536
01:58:39,362 --> 01:58:42,282
<i>Till there's a sunset</i>

1537
01:58:43,742 --> 01:58:49,539
<i>When all at once,
you'll be there</i>

1538
01:58:52,083 --> 01:58:58,298
<i>Then we'll kiss again</i>

1539
01:58:59,466 --> 01:59:02,761
<i>And again</i>

1540
01:59:02,844 --> 01:59:04,638
<i>And again</i>

1541
01:59:19,986 --> 01:59:21,404
Come on, Hank.

1542
01:59:29,287 --> 01:59:30,330
Mother!

1543
01:59:37,420 --> 01:59:39,172
I'm sorry we
were gone so long,

1544
01:59:39,255 --> 01:59:41,758
but we had to go over
and pick up Hank.
