1
00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:06,997
<i>I didn't sleep well last night, and
I woke up with a scratchy throat.</i>

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,808
<i>I just don't feel so
good. Uh, cough.</i>

3
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:14,573
Yeah, um-um, I have a bit of an

4
00:00:14,597 --> 00:00:17,546
upset stomach too, and I
think I'm running a fever.

5
00:00:17,618 --> 00:00:22,613
I'm just worried I
might be contagious.

6
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:27,525
Inventory. Tomorrow. I'm—Yeah,
I'm sure I'll be feeling better by then.

7
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:30,862
Thanks, Mr. Innabe.

8
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:36,627
I cannot believe
you just did that.

9
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:39,537
I-I really do have a cough.

10
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:41,939
Oh. So you weren't lying.

11
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:46,674
You'd be curled up in bed
with a bowl of chicken soup...

12
00:00:46,747 --> 00:00:48,909
Even if you didn't have
a horny girl in your bed?

13
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:52,976
Yes. Because I really do— Hey.

14
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:57,718
I really do have a cough.
You also have a little rash.

15
00:00:57,791 --> 00:01:03,458
Um, I'm not sure
we should be kissing.

16
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:07,695
Oh. It's okay. Because I have
almost no interest in kissing you.

17
00:01:07,768 --> 00:01:10,260
Perfect. Good.

18
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:15,465
Uh-uh-uh.

19
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,813
Oh, baby.

20
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:55,849
Oh, Brandon.

21
00:01:55,916 --> 00:01:59,910
Brandon.

22
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:04,452
I know I'm good, but come on.

23
00:02:06,927 --> 00:02:09,055
Brandon?

24
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:14,026
Brandon. Brandon. Brandon.

25
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:17,265
<i>Brandon! Brandon!</i>

26
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:55,298
<i>Any additional R. N. to Surgical.
Any additional R. N. to Surgical.</i>

27
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:12,217
<i>Why do you want
me to treat this guy?</i>

28
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:14,284
Blood pressure's not
responding to I.V. fluids.

29
00:03:14,361 --> 00:03:16,956
No, no. I didn't ask how you
plan to con me into treating him.

30
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,693
<i>I asked you why</i> you
<i>want me to treat him.</i>

31
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:22,429
He's sick. I care. I'm pathetic.

32
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:25,165
There are about a billion sick
people on the planet. Why this one?

33
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:29,232
Because this one's in our emergency
room. Ah, so it's a proximity issue.

34
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:30,716
If somebody was
sick in the third-floor

35
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,355
stairwell, that's who'd
we be talking about.

36
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:35,543
Yes. I checked the
stairwell. It's clear.

37
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:38,107
Okay, then. Emergency
room guy it is.

38
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:41,849
Wait. Why was that so
easy? You know why.

39
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:46,525
- Blood pressure's not responding to
I.V. fluids?
- Yeah.

40
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:50,759
That's just weird.

41
00:03:52,499 --> 00:03:55,628
C.B.C. was unremarkable. Abdominal
C.T. scan didn't show anything.

42
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:58,365
<i>So, people, differential
diagnosis. What's wrong with her?</i>

43
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:00,373
- Him.
- Him. Her. Does it matter?

44
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,605
Does anyone think it's a
testicular problem? No. So, Chase?

45
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:07,671
- Yersinia infection?
- No. You wouldn't get the rash or cough.

46
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:11,082
What about arthritis? Accompanying
vasculitis causes nerve damage...

47
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:14,952
- No. It wouldn't cause
the blood pressure problems. Allergy?
- The kid's got abdominal pain.

48
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:17,286
Maybe carcinoid? No. But
then you wouldn't get the...

49
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:19,700
Foreman, if you're going
to list all the things it's

50
00:04:19,724 --> 00:04:21,954
not, it might be quicker
to do it alphabetically.

51
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:27,160
Let's see, now. "Absidia." Excellent.
Doesn't account for any of the symptoms.

52
00:04:27,234 --> 00:04:30,068
- No condition accounts for
all these symptoms.
- Oh, good.

53
00:04:30,137 --> 00:04:33,198
Because I thought maybe he
was sick. But, apparently, he's not.

54
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,833
<i>Who wants to do up
the discharge papers?</i>

55
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:40,812
Okay. Unless we control
the blood pressure,

56
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:44,093
he's gonna start circling the drain before
we can figure out what's wrong with him.

57
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,335
Treat him for sepsis,
broad-spectrum antibiotics,

58
00:04:46,359 --> 00:04:48,646
and I want a Cort-stim
test and an echocardiogram.

59
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:58,462
You all right? Yeah.

60
00:04:58,532 --> 00:05:00,801
The Cort-stim test will
tell us if your pituitary

61
00:05:00,825 --> 00:05:02,697
and adrenal glands
are working properly.

62
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:05,933
- His glands? What does that mean?
- We have a few theories we're working on.

63
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:08,669
- You mean you don't know.
- Mindy.

64
00:05:08,742 --> 00:05:11,554
I'm just saying, if they knew they wouldn't
be testing you, they'd be treating you.

65
00:05:11,578 --> 00:05:14,062
<i>Yeah, well, that's the
way it works. First we</i>

66
00:05:14,086 --> 00:05:16,539
<i>find out what it is,
then we get you better.</i>

67
00:05:25,292 --> 00:05:28,353
You're half an hour
late. Busy caseload.

68
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:30,795
One case is not a load.

69
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:32,736
So how are we doing
on cotton swabs today? If

70
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,699
there's an acute shortage,
I could run home...

71
00:05:34,768 --> 00:05:38,261
No, you couldn't. Nice.

72
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:46,644
Hello, sick people
and their loved ones.

73
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:48,879
<i>In the interest of saving
time and avoiding a lot</i>

74
00:05:48,903 --> 00:05:51,048
<i>of boring chitchat later,
I'm Dr. Gregory House.</i>

75
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:55,384
You can call me Greg. I'm one of three
doctors staffing this clinic this morning.

76
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:59,586
Short. Sweet. Grab a file. This
ray of sunshine is Dr. Lisa Cuddy.

77
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:01,155
Dr. Cuddy runs this
whole hospital, so,

78
00:06:01,179 --> 00:06:03,206
unfortunately, she's much
too busy to deal with you.

79
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:06,826
I am a <i>board</i>-certified
diagnostician,

80
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,495
with a double specialty of
infectious disease and nephrology.

81
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:11,524
I'm also the only doctor
currently employed at this

82
00:06:11,548 --> 00:06:13,449
clinic who is forced to
be here against his will.

83
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:15,965
That is true, isn't
it? But not to worry.

84
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:19,740
Because for most of you, this job could be
done by a monkey with a bottle of Motrin.

85
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:23,909
<i>Speaking of which, if you’re particularly
annoying, you may see me reach for this.</i>

86
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:27,648
This is Vicodin. It's
mine. You can't have any.

87
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:31,715
And, no, I do not have a pain
management problem. I have a pain problem.

88
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:36,092
But who knows? Maybe I'm
wrong. Maybe I'm too stoned to tell.

89
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:38,495
<i>So, who wants me?</i>

90
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:44,771
And who would rather wait
for one of the other two guys?

91
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:51,001
Okay. Well, I'll be in Exam Room
One if you change your mind.

92
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,148
Jodi Matthews?

93
00:06:56,216 --> 00:06:59,516
Please accompany
Dr. House to Exam Room One.

94
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,087
<i>Dr. Chase.</i>

95
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,653
I'm not sure scaring your boyfriend
is the best medicine for him right now.

96
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:15,065
I know. I get stupid when I'm
scared. Don't go rock climbing.

97
00:07:15,135 --> 00:07:18,469
Look, I was wondering. Before
this happened, we were having sex.

98
00:07:20,874 --> 00:07:24,868
What? You're wondering if whatever
he has, you might've gotten it?

99
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,938
It-It's unlikely. We ran a
complete S.T.D. panel, so...

100
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:32,679
No. I'm wondering if maybe I
did this to him. I was kind of rough.

101
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:43,361
It was yellow. It <i>was</i>?

102
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:46,559
It's not anymore.
Well, that's a shame.

103
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:51,298
I thought that might be a
problem, so I brought you this.

104
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:58,802
Your mucus was "pale goldenrod."

105
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:02,576
Last week, yes. Should I
be worried? Oh, yes. Very.

106
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:06,086
Really? I thought
it was okay now.

107
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,644
And yet, here you
are. What happened?

108
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:11,282
Paramedics took a week
to respond to your 911 call?

109
00:08:11,358 --> 00:08:14,260
You're not a very
nice doctor, are you?

110
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:17,058
And you are very bad
at whatever it is you do.

111
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:20,430
You don't even know me. I
know you're gonna get fired.

112
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,596
That's why you got the new glasses.
That's why your teeth are sparkly white.

113
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:28,164
You're getting the most of your
health insurance while you still can.

114
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,668
I might be quitting.

115
00:08:31,745 --> 00:08:34,021
If you were quitting, you'd
have known that last week when

116
00:08:34,045 --> 00:08:36,306
your snot was still pale
goldenrod. You're getting fired.

117
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:40,580
I just don't like
being told what to do.

118
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:47,220
I can get you in for a full
body scan later this week.

119
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:49,785
Thanks.

120
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:55,299
<i>It's got to be viral. We should
start running gels and titers.</i>

121
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:59,464
Maybe we should look into the girlfriend's
theory. She thinks she rode him to death.

122
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,907
What'd you tell her?

123
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:05,445
I told her 22-year-old
men don't die of sex.

124
00:09:05,512 --> 00:09:07,606
- What'd you ask her?
- What do you mean?

125
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,673
I mean, I hope you got some
specifics on exactly what was going on.

126
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:14,585
If the girl thinks it could kill
you, it's worth knowing about.

127
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:20,117
Have you ever taken a life?

128
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:31,637
We should stop the antibiotics.

129
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:33,664
It's too soon to say
they're not having an effect.

130
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:35,800
They're having an effect.

131
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:40,973
<i>His B. P. 's falling fast.
There's fluid filling his lungs.</i>

132
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:43,312
His creatinine is rising.

133
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:51,314
<i>His kidneys are shutting down.</i>

134
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:57,025
<i>Our treatment isn't making
him better. It's killing him.</i>

135
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:02,736
<i>So, we had six symptoms
that didn't add up</i>

136
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,432
<i>to anything. Now we
got seven. Who's excited?</i>

137
00:10:05,505 --> 00:10:07,205
I don't think it
complicates things. The

138
00:10:07,229 --> 00:10:09,169
kidney failure was
caused by the antibiotics.

139
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:13,907
- Maybe.
<i>- Typically, low blood pressure</i>
<i>and abdominal pain means an infection.</i>

140
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,882
An abdominal infection causes
sepsis, low blood pressure.

141
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,886
Except we checked
for abdominal infections.

142
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,967
But what if it's the other
way around? What if the

143
00:10:21,991 --> 00:10:23,947
low blood pressure's
causing the abdominal pain?

144
00:10:24,023 --> 00:10:26,081
Viral heart infection.
The intestines aren't

145
00:10:26,105 --> 00:10:28,518
getting enough blood,
and the result is belly pain.

146
00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:32,555
- I know it's not
the standard presentation.
- It's a 10 million-to-1 shot.

147
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,295
I thought that's what
we dealt with here.

148
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:41,035
It explains the cardiomyopathy,
the pain, the low B.P., the fever.

149
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:47,207
You read the book. Impressive.

150
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,978
<i>It's a ludicrously long
shot that explains every one</i>

151
00:10:50,002 --> 00:10:52,776
<i>of those symptoms— except
for the cough and the rash.</i>

152
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:56,516
Should we just erase those?
Well, anything can cause a rash.

153
00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:01,626
Okay. Cardiac infection.
