00:00:04,037 --> 00:00:06,997
<i>I didn't sleep well last night, and
I woke up with a scratchy throat.</i>

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,808
<i>I just don't feel so
good. Uh, cough.</i>

3
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:14,573
Yeah, um-um, I have a bit of an

4
00:00:14,597 --> 00:00:17,546
upset stomach too, and I
think I'm running a fever.

5
00:00:17,618 --> 00:00:22,613
I'm just worried I
might be contagious.

6
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:27,525
Inventory. Tomorrow. I'm—Yeah,
I'm sure I'll be feeling better by then.

7
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:30,862
Thanks, Mr. Innabe.

8
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:36,627
I cannot believe
you just did that.

9
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:39,537
I-I really do have a cough.

10
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:41,939
Oh. So you weren't lying.

11
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:46,674
You'd be curled up in bed
with a bowl of chicken soup...

12
00:00:46,747 --> 00:00:48,909
Even if you didn't have
a horny girl in your bed?

13
00:00:48,982 --> 00:00:52,976
Yes. Because I really do— Hey.

14
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:57,718
I really do have a cough.
You also have a little rash.

15
00:00:57,791 --> 00:01:03,458
Um, I'm not sure
we should be kissing.

16
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:07,695
Oh. It's okay. Because I have
almost no interest in kissing you.
